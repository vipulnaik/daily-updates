## Donations List Website

Total estimate: 2 to 4 hours per week

Commits: https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commits

Regular tasks:

* Update Open Phil grantees (once per week). Can the frequency be
  changed? Changing the frequency doesn't affect the amount of work,
  except switching costs. At weekly frequency, switching costs are a
  small enough fraction of actual work.

Frequently occurring tasks:

* Update grantee information for other donors.
* Add some other documents as I notice them.
* Coordinate improvements made by Issa and update live database to
  reflect those improvements

## Contract work for Vipul Naik

Total estimate: 1-1.5 hours per week

Commits: https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/commits

* Monthly update for Issa. This usually takes about 1-1.5 hours of my
  time, plus some time of Issa's sending me his hours and date ranges
  per task.
  
* Regular task payments for Sebastian: This is done at least once a
  month but can be as high as wekly. In total, it takes about 15
  minutes per new article created by Sebastian. About 10-15 new
  articles are created per month.

## BART

Total estimate: 20 minutes per month, or 5 minutes per week on
average. Work done once a month, to add in the most recent month's
data into bart.vipulnaik.com

Details: https://github.com/vipulnaik/bart/blob/master/monthly-update-process.md

Commits: https://github.com/vipulnaik/bart/commits

Can the frequency be changed? I'd like to do the updates monthly to
make the site maximally useful

## Wikipedia Views

Total estimate: 30 minutes per month, or 7 minutes per week on
average. Work done once a month, to update month information and start
jobs to populate data for most recent month

Commits: https://github.com/vipulnaik/wikipediaviews/commits

Can the frequency be changed? I'd like to do the updates monthly to
make the site maximally useful.

## SSL certificate updated validity check

Total estimate: 30 minutes every 2 months, or about 3-4 minutes per
week on average.

Can the frequency be changed? We can go to close to 3 months, but that
might be cutting it close if there are genuine renewal issues

## VPS and software upgrades

Total estimate: Variable, can be 1-2 days a year on average. Many
pieces of the task need concentrated time.

Can the frequency be changed? Currently we have no fixed frequency,
and it is flexible to the specific needs/urgency of the time.

## Diet, exercise, and health updates

Still in the process of deciding what the regular updates here will
look like. I'm aiming to have regular update cost be less than 1 hour
per week, and hopefully less than 1 hour per month unless there are
clear short-run benefits that justify more.

## Subwiki error report checking

I haven't been doing this regularly, in a disciplined fashion. I
expect it to take about 20 minutes per week on average, with some
fluctuation. There may be a few hours of work catching up to the
historically accumulated error reports
