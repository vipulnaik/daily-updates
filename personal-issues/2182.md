## Personal projects

### Subject wikis

#### Groupprops

- [x] ~10 minutes: Make a few quick followup edits

## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~1 hour 20 minutes: Potatoes prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/3851a31625b508f1cd0125f3786b2dcbe06630bd excluding 25 minutes of prep time multiplexed with watching videos (15 minutes Ninja Nerd and 10 minutes smell video) and excluding cleanup time multiplexed with listening to stuff; the base amount of time cooking was higher than usual because I had to cut bell peppers in lieu of some of my tomatoes

### Health research, appointments, and recording

#### Planned events

- [x] ~30 minutes: Get COVID vaccine (counting journey to the place and getting the vaccine, not counting remaining time that I count under stocks) https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/623dbad619da8b5412d03756acbe8782f768a1c2
- [x] ~25 minutes: Make updates related to the COVID vaccine https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/623dbad619da8b5412d03756acbe8782f768a1c2

### Stocks

- [x] ~20 minutes: Get toiletries from Walgreens

### Updates tracking and planning

### Personal devops

- [x] ~55 minutes: Add script to verify that I've recently visited specific sites and pages (and flag the ones I haven't); use this script to streamline the logged-in verification checklist

## Other activities

### One-off conversations

- [x] ~10 minutes: Reply to a few messages

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the oncology playlist (including 15 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~20 minutes: Finish listening to a video

#### Topic-specific deep dives: smell

- [x] ~30 minutes: Watch / listen to a video
- [x] ~15 minutes: Listen to a video
