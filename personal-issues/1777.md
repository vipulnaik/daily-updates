- [x] ~1 hour: Expand timeline of web vitals (this was not a scheduled expansion; I originally planned to add one row but ended up finding other relevant material) https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/commits/master/misc-timelines/timeline-of-web-vitals.mediawiki?since=2024-12-01&until=2024-12-01
- [x] ~3 minutes: Do a quick read of timeline of BART (more for meta-thinking about timelines, though I did make a small change)

- [x] ~3 minutes: Take a few bureaucratic followup actions

## Other activities

### Periodic conversations

- [x] ~1 hour 10 minutes: Chat with parents
### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the cardiovascular medicine playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~25 minutes: Continue listening to a video
