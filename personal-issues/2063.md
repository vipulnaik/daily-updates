## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~55 minutes: Get groceries from Trader Joe's https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/2a9391850bc0abdb5a2534d4ed4efe1cdb59e912 (fewer items purchased than usual and short wait in line, both because I went near the store's closing time, so some stocks had run out and we were past peak crowdedness)

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~2 hours: Work on formalizing a bureaucratic process to help track it better
- [x] ~25 minutes: Make followup improvements and tie up a few loose ends related to a recently completed bureaucratic process

## Other activities

### AI safety learning

- [x] ~30 minutes: Continue listening to an audio podcast episode
- [x] ~55 minutes: Start listening to a video
