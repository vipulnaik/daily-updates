## Personal chores

### Updates tracking and planning

- [x] ~16 minutes: Add summaries for a recent week https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/b2ffd9853bca7810cf9d9dcee146a04cb6425c7e

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue ideating on the recent dental cleaning feedback

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to stuff): Sweep the bedroom and active use area of the hall

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [ ] ~50 minutes so far: Start listening to a video
