## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~1 hour: Get groceries from Trader Joe's https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/64d6a77da0c35e93fe2b6c8ad5c6a1fb55e9e5df

### Updates tracking and planning

- [x] ~16 minutes: Add summaries for a recent week https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/b2ffd9853bca7810cf9d9dcee146a04cb6425c7e
- [x] ~16 minutes: Add summaries for last week https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/7fb872a68fe81a84db885eeb1bf80d3da6415748
- [x] ~10 minutes: Add summaries for week so far https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/4ea06709bb581b6e342d55058d30782dd3c85140
- [x] ~15 minutes: Double-check num_cpc_ltbcs back to 2025-02-13; make fixes https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/7fb872a68fe81a84db885eeb1bf80d3da6415748 https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/853c6d86c2bbf5f6a531886d04465f44d9a8a35b (all the errors were for data backfilled several days after the events, suggesting that filling updates for recent data reduced the risk of errors, maybe because the experiences being fresh in my mind serve as a sanity check)

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~50 minutes: Start documenting a recent bureaucratic trip

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue ideating on the recent dental cleaning feedback

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to stuff): Sweep the bedroom and active use area of the hall

### Time management

- [x] ~5 minutes: Review my documents on time management (in preparation for macro planning work coming up)

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 45 minutes: Listen to a video
- [x] ~25 minutes: Start listening to a video
- [x] ~1 hour 20 minutes: Start listening to a video
