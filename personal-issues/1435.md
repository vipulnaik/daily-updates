## Personal projects

### Donations list website (DLW)

- [x] ~5 minutes: Fix a bug in the last data reload due to which pages not previously accessed were erroring

### Devops stuff

- [x] ~15 minutes: Debug why the DLW bug was not caught by my error log checker; make two kinds of fixes: one to reduce noise since it did get caught on one day, and the other to address potential reasons why it did not get caught on other days

## Personal chores

- [x] ~15 minutes: Continue with monthly house cleaning
- [x] ~10 minutes: Add weekday summaries https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/fb173790be3b3e85aea827b5196086bc7de6bd61
- [x] ~15 minutes: Look into a bureaucratic matter
- [x] ~30 minutes: Work on a travel-related checklist
- [x] ~5 minutes: Make Walgreens shopping list
- [x] ~35 minutes: Work on stuff related to travel bureaucracy

## House chores

- [x] ~2 minutes: Do monthly alarm checks
- [x] ~4 minutes: Send a message

## Family and career planning

- [x] ~5 minutes: Review some stuff

## Other activities

- [x] ~30 minutes: Reply to an email message with a group theory question (kinda related to groupprops, but I'm counting this as "other activities" rather than "personal projects" since it's not tied to any updates to groupprops)
- [x] ~5 minutes: Reply to an email
