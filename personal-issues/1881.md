## Other activities

### Facebook comments

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~15 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen
