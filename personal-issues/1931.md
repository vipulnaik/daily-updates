Starting this day, while in India, I use Indian Standard Time (IST) for my day boundaries.

## Personal chores

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~2 hours 15 minutes: Travel-related steps from the point of landing to getting to my parents' home
- [x] ~3 hours: Take care of a bunch of travel-related updates as well as improvement and streamlining of checklists (based on learnings from this time's execution experience)

## House chores

- [x] ~10 minutes: Refresh my memory and update my understanding on systems in my house
