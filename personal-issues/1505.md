## Personal chores

- [x] ~1 hour: Get back from the airport
- [x] ~2 hours 10 minutes: Work on various administrative tasks related to the completion of my trip, including unpacking, taking notes of the relevant parts of the trip, making sure things are working fine now that I'm back; this includes rounds of rereview that caught a bunch of minor typos, Spoonerisms, and dangling clauses that were present at a much higher rate than with my usual work, even though the underlying quality of my thought was good
- [x] ~35 minutes: Work on preparing a form (not for immediate submission, just as a hedge against needing it in the future) (this includes a round of additional review given my slightlly brainfogged state at the time of original edits, though the rereview did not flag issues with my first round of edits)
- [x] ~12 minutes: Rice prep
