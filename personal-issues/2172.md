### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist
- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the oncology playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen
