## Other activities

### Miscellaneous

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

- [x] ~5 minutes: Finish listening to a video
- [x] ~2 hours 15 minutes: Listen to a video (including some time multiplexed with recycling-related cleanup)

#### Deep dives into specific area: hearing and ear exams (motivated by my reduced hearing in left ear)

- [x] ~30 minutes: Continue watching the Ninja Nerd video series on the ear
- [x] ~15 minutes: Continue reading about hearing loss, frequencies, and audiograms
