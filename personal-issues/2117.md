## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~55 minutes: Get groceries from Trader Joe's (less stuff and no line to wait in) https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/e9bfba5ca2102af209962dfbba9d17dcb16cc699

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~35 minutes: Wrap up an administrative matter from yesterday; later, make a few updates to the documentation and tackle a few related loose ends

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~22 minutes: Do preparatory work for upcoming DEXA scan and flu shot https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/9346de2a3ff0bc2688826d614bc1a6468724f987

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to stuff): Clean toilet bowl

## Other activities

### One-off conversations

- [x] ~30 minutes: General chitchat with work colleagues during a work meeting as a result of not having agenda items

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist

### AI safety and implications

- [x] ~1 hour 40 minutes: Continue listening to a video
