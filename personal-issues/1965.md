## Personal projects

### Devops stuff

- [x] ~20 minutes: Discuss some devops stuff with a friend (the decisions here could inspire updates to my own devops stuff, but even if not, the projects they will help are aligned with my interests and overlap with projects I work on and fund)

## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] (no separate time tracked): RIce prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/3981e1fec3c8e93bb4f9a51180a8c1b47d0318c0 (multiplexed both prep and cleanup with listening to videos)

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~1 hour: Wrap up travel
- [x] ~45 minutes: Post-travel steps (excluding stuff related to regular personal cleaning activities that I happened to schedule differently due to recent travel, even though it is part of travel-related checklists); also, continue improving checklists in the process

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~35 minutes: Finish listening to a video
- [x] ~30 minutes: Start listening to a video
