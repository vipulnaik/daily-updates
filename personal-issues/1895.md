## Personal finances, income and taxes

### US taxes

- [x] ~3 hours 40 minutes: Continue work on US taxes

## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~1 hour 15 minutes: Potatoes prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/9a7d0b39e831397ac1d6b84bbad56e39c063f002 excluding 20 minutes multiplexed with watching Ninja Nerd videos and 20 minutes effective multiplexed with dictating a doc (the total time for dictating the doc was about 30 minutes effective, but 10 minutes is my estimate for the inefficiency induced by multiplexing)

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~30 minutes: Dictate a doc

## Other activities

### Facebook comments

- [x] ~7 minutes: Post a few Facebook comments

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~40 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist (including 20 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep)
