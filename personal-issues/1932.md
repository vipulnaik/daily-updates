## Personal chores

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~3 hours: Continue work on travel documentation and checklist improvement
- [x] ~25 minutes: Document the sleep cycle adjustment process after completion of travel (and also wrap up a bit of pending documentation from prior to departure); do further testing to benchmark myself (recording deferred for tomorrow)
- [x] ~1 hour: Work on bureaucratic planning

### Personal devops

- [x] ~2 hours: Investigate in depth an issue with System Settings updates not taking effect, leading to a partial diagnosis, then file a report with Apple about it https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/commit/c67f7b431cb367fca2783561389680fc11a6c914
- [x] ~5 minutes: Look briefly into night shift settings
