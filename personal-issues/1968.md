## Personal chores

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~6 minutes: Take care of a couple of post-trip items

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~45 minutes: Look into a bunch of stuff related to not feeling well https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/dbe9055e145b3ce79ffd3f7c4abcc4d405f5f25b https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/b4490ce907de1ac1b39e2cd39fe80666471b90b0 https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/22899dde8f78dc791b7e9d7fac76adca912809f5

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~15 minutes: Continue watching (rewatching, but the original watching was a while ago and is very faint in my mind) content from the neurology playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~25 minutes: Start listening to a video
