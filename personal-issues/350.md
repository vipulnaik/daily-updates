## Personal chores

- [x] ~5 minutes: Place order for a new set of [glass food storage containers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WT6K984/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1); I wanted more to give myself the flexibility to cook multiple times a week for two weeks. See https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2019-12-30-decision-to-switch-to-glass-food-storage.md for the original decision

## Other
