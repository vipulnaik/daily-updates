## Personal chores

### Laundry

- [x] ~23 minutes: Regular laundry excluding clothes sorting that I multiplexed with listening to a video
- [x] ~16 minutes: Document updated laundry room process and reiterate importance of a few steps

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~3 minutes: Update air travel checklist to include browsing history download in things affected by time zone change

### Personal devops

- [x] ~10 minutes: Download browsing history; this step took a little longer than usual due to additional steps of time zone adjustment and splitting to separate out the part in India where the time zone was different (this also involved some one-time effort to figure out how to construct the right regular expression to grep for the correct set of dates -- something I won't need to do in the future)

### Clothing

- [x] ~1 hour 5 minutes: Continue with shoe research

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~15 minutes: Do periodic stethoscope check for heart sounds and diaphragm sounds
- [x] ~5 minutes: Add extreme short distance vision test to vision checklist https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/f4c92613bf16a13b7f97897efb817ff8bf110b28

### Contingency planning

- [x] ~20 minutes: Execute on blindness fire drill (the laptop piece) and do research and setup for the phone piece so I can start executing that next time

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~55 minutes: Continue listening to a video (with intermittent watching)

### Language learning

- [x] ~40 minutes: Continue listening to content from the [Kannada sikhen playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjR_rtaV4PoSw6otyVdpv9qeJh3oNgjo8)
