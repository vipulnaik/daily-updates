### Personal devops

- [x] ~3 minutes: Laptop surface and screen cleaning
- [x] ~1 hour: Do periodic review and sorting of files (this does not include the portion of the time spent on day job)

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~25 minutes: Continue watching new content from the cardiovascular pharmacology playlist (including 15 minutes multiplexed with eggplant meal prep)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~45 minutes: Finish watching / listening to a video (including 30 minutes multiplexed with eggplant meal prep)
- [x] ~1 hour 50 minutes: Start watching / listening to a video (large parts of this were multiplexed with house cleaning, so I am not counting the house cleaning time separately)
