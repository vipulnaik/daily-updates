### Personal devops

- [x] ~15 minutes: Experiment with newly purchased bone conduction headphones and document my observations; also record the various other headphones purchases and stow away the extra headphones

### Stocks

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist (including 10 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 20 minutes: Start listening to a video
