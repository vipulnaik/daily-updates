## Devops stuff (this is a quasi-blocker to subwiki stuff)

- [x] Upgrade MediaWiki for learning subwiki (to 1.35) and make sure its status is clean
- [x] (PARTIAL PROGRESS) Get market subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade
- [ ] Get mech subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade

## Subwiki stuff

- [x] (PARTIAL PROGRESS) Work on calculus subwiki (there is no fixed agenda, but I have the idea of updating some pages, such as "point of local extremum implies critical point", to match the standard set by other pages such as "product rule for differentiation)
- [ ] (IDEATION but no substantive progress) Work on learning subwiki (I have a long list at https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/User:Vipul, as well as some nascent ideas around sub-directions within those pages)
  - This is quasi-blocked by the learning subwiki upgrade.

## Wikipedia stuff

- [ ] Work on the "Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures" page from https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/pages-to-create.md and potentially work on some of the other tax-related pages
  - This is not blocked on anything per se, but I'm likely to prioritize the devops stuff over it; I'm fine if this gets pushed to next week due to subwiki stuff taking precedence!

## Timelines wiki stuff (not originally planned)

- [x] Update timeline of BART
- [ ] (PARTIAL PROGRESS) Update timeline of AI safety
