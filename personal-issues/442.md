## Personal chores

- [x] ~5 minutes: Record my sore throat https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/44a43d10915f6e72413fce89a8bea44de9487945

## Other activities

- [x] ~15 minutes: Advise a friend on a personal matter
- I also spent a lot of time watching Hotel Del Luna while working at a reduced pace (reduced pace of work is reflected in the way I counted work hours). I am not formally counting my time spent watching Hotel Del Luna, but it was probably about 1-2 hours net after accounting for the multiplexing of time.
