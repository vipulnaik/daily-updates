### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~5 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist
- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the circulatory system playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

 - [x] ~35 minutes: Start listening to an audio episode
 - [x] ~10 minutes: Download a few notes

#### Deep dives into specific area: hearing and ear exams (motivated by my reduced hearing in left ear)

- [x] ~15 minutes: Continue watching the Ninja Nerd video series on the ear
