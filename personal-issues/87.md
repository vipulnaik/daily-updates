## Financial

- [x] Sell $201 worth of BTC
  - I wanted to sell in the range of a hundred dollars
  - However, I chose this amount because up till this amount, Coinbase charged a fee of $2.99, and after that the fee scaled linearly with the amount (if I had sold $100 I would still have paid $2.99).
