## Personal chores

### Personal devops

- [x] ~10 minutes: Take care of a few updates and also use the opportunity to update the associated instructions a little bit
### Contingency planning

- [x] ~25 minutes: Put together first pass of a cheatsheet around a specific contingency planning process (I wasn't planning to do so, but an accidental action led me to realize the importance of doing it)

### Time management

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue expanding notes on optimizing long sessions doing complex tasks

### Clothing

- [x] ~3 minutes: Take care of an item related to shoe research

## Other activities

### One-off conversations

- [x] ~10 minutes: Have a brief conversation to discuss an update

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~45 minutes: Continue listening to a video
