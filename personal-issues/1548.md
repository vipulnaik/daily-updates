## Devops stuff

- [x] Finish getting groupprops subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade
- [x] Get mech subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade

## Subwiki stuff

- [ ] Work on calculus subwiki
- [ ] Work on cellbio subwiki

## Wikipedia stuff

- [ ] (PARTIAL PROGRESS) Work on the "Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures" page from https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/pages-to-create.md and potentially work on some of the other tax-related pages
  - This is not blocked on anything per se, but I'm likely to prioritize the devops stuff over it; I'm fine if this gets pushed to next week due to subwiki stuff taking precedence!
  - (PROGRESS UPDATE) I did not quite start work on this, but I started reading related material and started drafting the FinCEN Form 114 page.

## Timelines wiki stuff

- [ ] Continue updating timeline of AI safety

## Donations list website (DLW) stuff

- [ ] Continue updating grants data related to AI safety; this might be a good time to do this as it complements the timelines wiki updates
