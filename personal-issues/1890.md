## Other activities

### One-off conversations

- [x] ~3 minutes: Reply to a few messages

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd podcast videos: eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~25 minutes: Listen to Ninja Nerd podcast (10 minutes multiplexed with at-home jogging and 15 minutes approximately multiplexed with soaking portion of rice prep)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 10 minutes: Start listening to a video (5 minutes multiplexed with at-home jogging, 5 minutes multiplexed with untracked light recording and catchup, 35 + 20 minutes multiplexed with post-meal cleanup, and 5 minutes before sleep)
