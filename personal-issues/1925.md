## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to videos): Lentils prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/1a23d0711f574f40912c5147732cc4af1c8f6d35
- [x] ~5 minutes: Rice prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/6a49a1099867edf9a130a33354f009f86b035ebc including 5 minutes of prep time (the rest was multiplexed with listening to videos) but none of the cleanup time as I multiplexed cleanup time with border security videos

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~2 hours 30 minutes: Continue work on travel planning (mix of general and specific)

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 5 minutes: Start listening to a video

#### Patient stories

- [x] ~15 minutes: Start listening to a video

### Other topics

- [x] ~1 hour: Watch a bunch of videos on topics such a flight diversion and border security
