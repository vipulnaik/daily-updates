## Personal projects

### Contract work for Vipul Naik

- [x] ~30 minutes: Add January 2023 payments due to @sebastiansanchez123 https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/commit/2542f2c9832fa8bf70b1352b51324d26235376ce and also email Pablo with an update; the whole process took a bit longer than usual because of more items than in a typical month as an error in initial data entry that needed a careful correction

### WordPress sites

- [x] ~25 minutes: Upgrade plugins for my WordPress sites; this may be the last manually conducted set of upgrades as I hope to automate the upgrade process in March after addition of a url-checking service

## Personal finances, income and taxes

- [x] ~20 minutes: Add January 2023 end-of-month balances and take some related actions https://github.com/vipulnaik/personal-finances/commit/89177e8f3737c7661eeae758b35b170f5dc69b56

## Personal chores
