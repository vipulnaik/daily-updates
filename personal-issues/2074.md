## Personal finances, income and taxes

### US taxes

### Laundry

- [x] ~23 minutes: Heavy laundry excluding clothes sorting time multiplexed with listening to a video

### Updates tracking and planning

- [x] ~10 minutes: Finish adding updates for a week in the past https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/92a2a1dbc8f9ea1ecdc72455f61c251b80ea794a (the week summary ended up taking way more time than expected because I had to review what had happened in the week, not being able to rely on memory -- the tracked time of 10 minutes is an underestimate)
