## Personal finances, income and taxes

### US taxes

- [x] ~34 minutes: Wrap up a bunch of loose threads related to US taxes; in particular, this includes reviewing the paper correspondence I received and confirming that it is subsumed by the stuff I've already received digitally

## Personal chores

### Laundry

- [x] ~4 minutes: Failed attempt to start laundry

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~7 minutes: Do some health recording, including https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/6dc19e9285963a40a73adefe22287d2abb774ff2 https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/3bb6bbec03ac75b2bdcda703ea27011788ba16a8

### Administrative

- [x] ~5 minutes: Process some snail mail (excluding taxes stuff  covered under personal finances), discard or file it, and note the filing details
- [x] ~3 minutes: Submit an expense report

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~25 minutes: Continue watching new content from the renal medicine playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~5 minutes: Continue listening to a video
