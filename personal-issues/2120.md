## Personal finances, income and taxes

### Financial tracking and recording

- [x] ~1 hour: Add balances for end of July 2025, plus do a bunch of other related work (this took longer than usual, partly because some of the balances needed to be reconstructed, and partly because I hadn't logged in to many of the services for a while so the authentication steps took more time in various cases, and partly because various actions normally done monthly bunched up) https://github.com/vipulnaik/personal-finances/commit/239e28b77becdaa7e701d81c8459b6c42752e097

## Personal chores
