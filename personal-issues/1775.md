## Personal projects

### Monthly tasks

- [x] ~10 minutes: Go through and mark completion or skipping of various monthly tasks

#### Meta

- [x] ~15 minutes: Split out month change checklist executions into individual files
- [x] ~1 hour: Revamp month change checklists to reduce the amount per month (by reducing frequency) and reduce decision fatigue (by being more prescriptive about what to do each month)

### Periodic cleaning

- [x] ~4 minutes: Check condition of and clear hair from caster wheels
- (no additional time as I multiplexed this with listening to a video; the total duration of video listen was 25 minutes so this was less than that) Sweep and wet wipe various areas of the hall

## Other activities

### One-off conversations

- [x] ~1 hour 15 minutes: Have an impromptu conversation

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the cardiovascular medicine playlist (all 20 minutes were multiplexed with potatoes prep)
- [x] ~50 minutes: Continue watching new content from the endocrine medicine playlist (including 5 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep)
- [x] ~2 minutes: Review some older content from the cardiovascular medicine playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~25 minutes: Continue listening to a video (this covered time multiplexed with sweeping and wet wiping of the hall)
