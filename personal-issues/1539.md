## Devops stuff

- [x] Finish getting market subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade
- [ ] Get mech subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade

Not originally planned:

- [ ] (PARTIAL PROGRESS): Get groupprops subwiki ready for MediaWiki upgrade
  - I decided to give higher priority to groupprops over mech after spending some time debugging a few issues for groupprops

## Subwiki stuff

- [x] Work on calculus subwiki (there is no fixed agenda, but I have the idea of updating some pages, such as "point of local extremum implies critical point", to match the standard set by other pages such as "product rule for differentiation)
- [ ] Work on learning subwiki (I have a long list at https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/User:Vipul, as well as some nascent ideas around sub-directions within those pages)
- [x] Work on cellbio subwiki (flesh out the outer mitochondrial membrane and inner mitochondrial membrane pages more)

## Wikipedia stuff

- [ ] Work on the "Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures" page from https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/pages-to-create.md and potentially work on some of the other tax-related pages
  - This is not blocked on anything per se, but I'm likely to prioritize the devops stuff over it; I'm fine if this gets pushed to next week due to subwiki stuff taking precedence!

## Timelines wiki stuff

- [ ] Continue updating timeline of AI safety

## Donations list website (DLW) stuff

- [ ] Continue updating grants data related to AI safety; this might be a good time to do this as it complements the timelines wiki updates
