## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~7 minutes: Document more of my food structure in India

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to the Korean podcast) Do a basic sweep of the bedroom (not a super-thorough sweep but enough to address incremental dirt accumulation)

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist, including 15 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~5 minutes: Continue listening to a video
- [x] ~40 minutes: Start listening to a video

### Language learning

- [x] ~5 minutes: Take a Korean vocabulary quiz at https://learning-korean.com/elementary/20210101-1578/ (score of 9/11)
- [x] ~50 minutes: Listen to videos on Kannada from [Kannada sikhen playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjR_rtaV4PoSw6otyVdpv9qeJh3oNgjo8) (with Hindi as the language of instruction)
- [x] ~10 minutes: Listen to [Korean podcast for intermediate (informal)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw8MPosKJuVXQEJwCWWpZFBHmSWOZsiV_)
