## Personal projects

### Groupprops subwiki

- [x] ~15 minutes: Take care of a couple of threads and make a checklist to more reliably execute the relevant pieces in the future (I didn't miss anything this time, but I didn't have a formal checklist to reference and "almost" missed some things)

## Personal chores

### Laundry

- [x] ~23 minutes: Heavy laundry (excluding clothes sorting time that was multiplexed with listening to a video)

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~2 hours 40 minutes: Continue working through administrative stuff

### Personal devops

- [x] ~5 minutes: Put together a document manipulation cheatsheet

## Other activities

### Periodic conversations

- [x] ~15 minutes: Participate briefly in an informal catchup with work colleagues

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~5 minutes: Finish listening to a video

### Law learning

- [x] ~40 minutes: Finish listening to (and partially watching) a video
- [x] ~10 minutes effective: Start listening to a video (actual listen time was about 17 minutes but it included a lot of inaudible student responses)
- [x] ~10 minutes: Start listening to a video
- [x] ~15 minutes: Start listening to a video
