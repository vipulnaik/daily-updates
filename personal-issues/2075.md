## Personal finances, income and taxes

### US taxes

## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] (no separate time tracked as both prep and cleanup were multiplexed with listening to videos): Rice prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/e14efa63af985f9930a8b250985bebcc6000314c

### Personal devops

- [x] ~10 minutes: Add partial incremental Slack self-chat logs (I just did two weeks instead of the full duration of about 7.5 weeks due to being crunched for time; I did want to get the oldest stuff in before it gets too far in the past)
