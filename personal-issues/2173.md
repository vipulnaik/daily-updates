## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] (no separate time tracked as both prep and cleanup were multiplexed with listening to stuff): Rice prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/dcb182fca5c7a853b73eb305665663f93dd9f685
- [x] ~55 minutes: Eggplant meal prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/3e483ffd12c07a42116dad64be05482e44102362 excluding 30 minutes of prep time multiplexed with watching Ninja Nerd and excluding cleanup time multiplexed with listening to stuff

### Laundry

- [x] ~12 minutes (NOT LTBC): Sort heavy laundry load done Tuesday (not multiplexed with listening to stuff as I hit my cognitive limit of passive optional cognitive stimulation (POCS) at about 5 hours, of which 4 hours was health-related stuff)

### Personal devops

- [x] ~1 minute: Check charge state of power banks

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] ~10 minutes (did not multiplex with listening to stuff; I thought it'd be quick but it took more time): Clean the insinkerator and associated garbage disposal
- [x] ~2 minutes (only for documentation; the work itself was multiplexed with listening to stuff): Clean out caster wheels of office chair

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~40 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist (including 30 minutes multiplexed with eggplant meal prep)
- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the oncology playlist 

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~50 minutes: Finish listening to a video
- [x] ~2 hours 20 minutes: Start listening to a video

### Other video/audio consumption of an educational nature

- [x] ~1 hour: Watch / listen to a video
