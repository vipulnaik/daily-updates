## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

### Updates tracking and planning

- [x] ~45 minutes: Work with Claude to write a parser for daily updates, to speed up the process of generating summaries https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/4e53d547484371936873d820ef74e8d9b2b949a8
- [x] ~5 minutes: Add weekend summaries and week summary (2 days + 1 week) https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/4e53d547484371936873d820ef74e8d9b2b949a8 (NOTE: with the automation of part of the summary generation, the formula going forward for time is 1 minute + (number of days) minutes + 2 * (number of weeks) minutes, accounting for the aspects that I still need to do manually)
