## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~30 minutes: Eggplant meal prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/02e93c790c6e5b72c58a8bbca89cb007cbb65d1f excluding 40 minutes multiplexed with a call and 25 minutes multiplexed with listening to videos and also excluding cleanup time multiplexed with listening to videos (cutting took longer as I added an extra eggplant but I had fewer tomatoes, so net extra is about 10 minutes)
- [x] (no separate time tracked as both prep and cleanup were multiplexed with listening to videos) Rice prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/8893681ac1ba253db0eab4db1c1df802ea77f6a4

## Other activities

### Periodic conversations

- [x] ~40 minutes: A quarterly catch-up call (multiplexed with eggplant meal prep)
- [x] ~1 hour 30 minutes: Weekly chat with mother

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~50 minutes: Start listening to a video (including 10 minutes multiplexed with eggplant meal prep and an unspecified amount of time covering eggplant meal prep cleanup)
- [x] ~25 minutes: Start listening to a video (including an unspecified amount of time covering rice prep cleanup))

#### Topic-specific deep dives: digestive health

- [x] ~1 hour 5 minutes: Listen to a video (including 5 minutes multiplexed with eggplant meal prep and 25 minutes in and around rice prep)

### Language learning
