## Personal projects

### Donations list website (DLW)

- [x] ~18 minutes: Investigate and band-aid the issue of missing similarity tables; the band-aid is to just create the empty tables for now and defer the task of figuring out whether and how to run the tasks of populating the tables https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commit/8b66cbb20833a0e17652e9fc0690911d519762b8 https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commit/aed32611586d9b5ac38a01bab19f28ca9c52c9dd
