## Personal finances, income and taxes

### Financial tracking and recording

- [x] ~2 minutes: Verify and record a financial transaction https://github.com/vipulnaik/personal-finances/commit/8beaa38717dd2b81dbead6292c55fbc5715ddad9

## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed with listening to videos): Rice prep https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/dbaf37038481dc63c101b70b70bdf54f2d6df315 

### Health research, appointments, recording

- [x] ~3 minutes: Take a pulse oximeter reading https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/2c27f1cb678098907b2f77b1d084fe5db5c01f16
- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue with health documentation https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/bcd82163ad9e3c9b8ee8d988d8b2dbcb4455d01c https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/17572c17c71f91427b4e4298a6a5d71897d6a2d4

### Personal devops

- [x] ~6 minutes: Take care of various OS and software updates

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~5 minutes: Continue watching (rewatching, but the original watching was a while ago and is very faint in my mind) content from the neurology playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 45 minutes: Continue listening to a video
