### Updates tracking and planning

- [x] ~30 minutes: Do a bunch of crunch planning (while the crunch is partly created by travel, the activities being planned are themselves mostly unrelated to travel)

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~50 minutes: Wrap up doc on food stock-taking before trips
- [x] ~1 hour 15 minutes: Continue with various aspects of trip planning

### Periodic cleaning tasks

- [x] (no separate time tracked because I multiplexed this with listening to a video): Rinse out dish soap bottles, drain soaked olive oil bottles, rinse a condiment bottle
- [x] (no separate time tracked because I multiplexed this with listening to a video): Clean out underportion of stove and individual stoves

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Medical school curriculum education: Ninja Nerd videos (focused learning with eyes on screen for the most part)

- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neuro pathology playlist
- [x] ~20 minutes: Continue watching new content from the neurology playlist (all 20 minutes multiplexed with potatoes prep)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 50 minutes: Finish listening to a video
- [x] ~10 minutes: Start listening to a video
