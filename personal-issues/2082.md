## Personal chores

### Cooking and food purchases

- [x] ~55 minutes: Get groceries from Trader Joe's https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/8409d953d94fa70fe21b2f7f0b07e55854b09bfc (slightly faster than usual due to effective multiplexing with administrative trip, slightly smaller purchase load, and no queue at Trader Joe's)

### Laundry

- [x] (no separate time tracked as I multiplexed this with listening to stuff): Sort clean laundry clothes from yesterday's laundry

### Administrative / travel / bureaucracy

- [x] ~1 hour 5 minutes: Administrative trip https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/8409d953d94fa70fe21b2f7f0b07e55854b09bfc plus preparation and followup documentation (some of the journey was effectively multiplexed with Trader Joe's, so less than the total amount of time I would have spent otherwise)

## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 15 minutes: Finish listening to a video
- [x] ~35 minutes: Listen to a video
