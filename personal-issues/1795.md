## Other activities

### Health learning (general stuff that is not tied to immediate personal health action and doesn't involve active documentation work)

- [x] ~5 minutes: Continue watching new content from the circulatory system playlist
- [x] ~10 minutes: Continue watching new content from the respiratory medicine playlist

#### Health optimization space education: content not designed for concentrated education, eyes don't have to be on screen

- [x] ~1 hour 10 minutes: Listen to a video
- [x] ~1 hour: Start re-listening to another video (that I had listened to a while back but want to now understand in more depth) (multiplexed with potatoes prep)
- [x] ~5 minutes: Do some further reading
