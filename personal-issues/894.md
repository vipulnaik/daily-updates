## Personal chores

- [x] ~17 minutes: Add summaries for past week and May 2022 month summary

## House chores

- [x] ~15 minutes: Get 9V batteries from Target (the round trip itself was covered under other time, so only the actual time in shop is being counted), then try and fail to put them in smoke detector (apparently the battery isn't the correct one despite being the right voltage and approximately the right size)
