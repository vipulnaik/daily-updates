# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: July 28, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

I started going down to 75% time at work mostly starting July, with a
little bit of a trial period in the period of April to June (most of
it during late May / early June).

## Diet, exercise, and health (September 2021 onward, off and on)

### Dentist trip for periodontal therapy (dental deep cleaning)

In my [dental cleaning trip of August
11](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2021-08-11-dental-cleaning-trip.md)
I was recommended a course of periodontal therapy. My two appointments
happened on September 29 and October 6. I have a followup care appointment scheduled for December 15.q

### Eye checkup (not scheduled, vague plans)

I haven't had an eye checkup in over ten years. I have scheduled an
appointment for a comprehensive eye exam for October 29 at 12 PM.

### Other rethinking of exercise and measurement tools

I would like to start thinking about regular exercise beyond my daily
jog and crushing exercises -- basically some flexibility-type exercise
(e.g., yoga, tai chi) and possibly also weight training. I will need
to think more about this and introduce gradually.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW)

I have successfully resumed work on the donations list website (DLW)
and expect to continue on it till at least the end of September, and
probably till the end of 2021.

## Continuation of migration stuff (alternated with DLW)

I have successfully resumed work on migration stuff, mostly in the form
of more work on migration-related timelines. I expect to continue with
this flavor of work till at least September 2021, and probably with
some form of migration-related work (this or something else) till the
end of the year.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Managing personal projects blog post (some time between October 2021 and March 2022)

I wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. Now that I've reduced my work hours and am putting the
principles into practice, I would like to review, refine, and publish
the blog post. I expect to do so not before October 2021, which should
give me enough experience actually applying the ideas over a time
period where I'm devoting a significant chunk of time to personal
projects.

### Donation budgets / targets blog post (some time between December 2021 and May 2022)

I want to write a blog post outlining my thinking on donation
budgets. My current thinking is something of a 1,000 USD / month
maximum (with accumulation) starting January 2021. Ideally, I want to
write this blog post *before* making more donations; however, I
won't block a donation decision on the blog post if it is well within
the broad bounds.

There are a couple of reasons I want to defer writing this blog post,
even though it would be nice to have it written so I can use it to
inform donation decisions:

* I want to get more caught up with donations list website (DLW), and
  I think that things I learn during that process will inform my
  thinking. I'm focusing on DLW for the next few months and expect to
  be in a good position with it by December 2021.
* Overall, I am in a good position with my personal finances, but I am
  still sorting out a few items, including figuring out things related
  to how much to allocate to stocks, and how to deal with variability
  in housing expenses. I hope and expect to acquire more clarity on
  these fronts over the next few months.

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, any time in the next several months)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly mid-2022 but could be earlier)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

## Devops/server maintenance work (deferred to ~January 2022)

UPDATE July 28, 2021: I have decided to defer this work to ~January
2022, by which time I expect to have more free time available for it.

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).
