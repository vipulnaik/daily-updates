# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: October 18, 2023

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Summary by quarter

Quarter | Primary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Secondary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Side things, such as blog posts
-- | -- | -- | --
Q4 2023 | DLW data entry, continue devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time), set up new subwikis | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, AI safety stuff | Pick whatever makes sense
Q1 2024 | Finish devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time), DLW data entry, AI safety subwiki work| Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, family planning, potentially one or more from my other projects (such as stuff related to cause prioritization, Diet Watch, CDP, devec, etc.) | Pick whatever makes sense
Q2 2024 | DLW data entry, AI safety subwiki expansion | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects (such as stuff related to cause prioritization, Diet Watch, CDP, devec, etc.) | Pick whatever makes sense
Q3 2024 | DLW data entry, AI safety subwiki expansion | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects | Probably several posts, as my DLW data entry and timelines wiki work will generate several ideas

## Work situation (September 2023 onward)

As of the end of August / start of September 2023, my work situation
is pretty good; I am now aiming to stick to my half-time goal, with my
median week being a little *less* than half-time, giving me some room
to surge during periods when there are high-priority items. Based on
feedback received from co-workers about my effective output over the
past few months, this seems like a reasonably safe strategy in terms
of producing enough output. With that said, I should revisit the
strategy every few months and adjust upward or downward as needed.

To be more concrete, I'm planning to target the following with work:

* I will be work-focused on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, though I
  might still take out time for time-sensitive personal chores. I
  expect to average at least 3 focused hours per day for these three
  days.

* I will try to be responsive on Slack and work email on Wednesday and
  Friday. I expect that *de facto* I'll end up spending 30-60 minutes
  per day on these days, but I will not be *trying* to spend time at
  work on these days.

* I aim to follow these *absolute minimum* weekly targets:

  * At least 6 hours on weeks that I have not marked any day off

  * At least 4 hours on weeks that I have marked one day off

  * At least 2 hours on weeks that I have marked two days off

* I aim to follow these *conditional minimum* weekly targets: *at
  least one* of the following must be true:

  * At least 9 hours in the week

  * At least 10 hours averaging over the week and the two previous
    weeks (i.e., a 3-week moving average)

* I aim to follow these *conditional maximum* weekly targets: *at
  least one* of the following must be true:

  * At most 13 hours in the week

  * At most 12 hours averaging over the week and the two previous
    weeks (i.e., a 3-week moving average)

While the above describe the minimum targets, I might spend more time
in a give week either due to time-sensitive stuff at work or if it
makes sense given the nature of the work I am trying to complete.

## Chores to catch up on

### Health stuff

- [ ] Targeting for 2023-12 or 2024-01: COVID-19 vaccine booster shot
- [ ] Targeting for mid-to-late 2024: Get next round of blood tests done

### House stuff

I've added a bunch of ongoing house cleaning to my month change
checklist; however, there are some less frequent aspects of house
cleaning I'd like to tackle one-off and then maybe set a cadence for
them such as a quarterly or annual cadence. These include:

- [ ] Targeting for 2023-12: Full vacuuming
- [ ] Targeting for 2023-12: Washing of mattress protector and pillow protectors
- [ ] Targeting for 2023-12: Cleaning of hard-to-reach areas (area under stove, crevices in kitchen, etc.)

### India trip stuff

The full list is not (yet) public; a few select items are below:

- [ ] Stuff related to packing, possibly including suitcase purchase
- [ ] Get Indian rupees (INR) cash

## Devops/server maintenance work through 2023

### Server migration resumption (November 2023, December 2023, and Q1 2024)

I did a bunch of server migration work in Q2 2023, then took a break
to deal with wisdom tooth removal and taxes. I need to resume server
migration work, and I expect it to be a major focus starting November
2023.

I have a private gameplan that I need to flesh out more.

### Digital will (likely Q2 2024)

After the more cleaned-up state I create with the server migration,
I'd like to revisit my digital will and restructure it in a way that
is more robust.

### Setting up additional subwikis starting November 2023 or later

External commitments: Update in November 2023 promised to person
who requested subwiki setup.

Once I have streamlined by subwiki setup process and moved to a new
server, I'll streamline the process for setting up brand *new*
subwikis, and then set up additional subwikis. One such possibility is
an AI safety subwiki.

While there may be more subwikis to add, I expect that the process
will get streamlined more and more and the incremental effort of
adding new subwikis will be low.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) in 2023 and 2024: potentially ongoing work

External commitments: Update in Q4 2023 promised to potential
collaborator/contributor.

I've resumed DLW work in October 2023 and plan to continue it through
the rest of 2023 and then 2024. However, I will be prioritizing devops
work and Google Analytics migration work over DLW work to the extent
that I feel in the mood to do devops work.

While I have a lot to catch up with on DLW to begin with, I don't yet
have a clear sense of what the steady-state ongoing work level will be
once I have caught up.

## Timelines wiki work

### Getting and staying on top of "Timelines I keep expanding regularly" starting November 2023

My goal for November and December 2023 is to get on top of the table
of "Timelines I keep expanding regularly on my [user
page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Vipul).

### More regular work from Q1 2024 onward

For the most part, work on timelines will be lower-priority for me
than work on devops or DLW, but based on mood I might still end up
doing a fair amount of work on timelines.

### Work that has synergies with DLW work, and resultant EA Forum posts in 2024 or later

I want to work on a bunch of timelines in the timelines wiki that have
synergies with the work I'm doing on DLW. While doing this, the
synergistic work will also give rise to ideas that I might develop
into EA Forum posts.

### Meta work

Another side-effect of the above-mentioned work on timelines wiki will
be more updates on general practices with timelines wiki, that I plan
to then share with Sebastian and help inform his work as well. I also
plan to make active efforts to articulate meta policies in
collaboration with Issa and Sebastian.

## Rethinking exercise (Q2 or Q3 2024)

I added a few exercises (Buteyko-style control pause breath holds,
hand gripper exercises) in Q3 2023. I also do occasional flexibility
exercises.

I expect to do my next round of rethinking exercise in Q2 2024 or Q3
2024.

## Family planning work starting Q4 2023

I want to think systematically about having a family -- the search for
a life partner, the various steps involved with having kids, and
more. I've been thinking off and on about this but haven't been
systematically documenting my thoughts. In Q4 2023 I'm going to start
writing (private) notes documenting my thoughts on a variety of
aspects of this. The hope is that this could inform relevant actions
in 2023 such as searching for a partner or looking into other life
change options.

I'm probably not going to say a lot about this publicly except that
I'm thinking about the topic.

## More reading/learning around AI safety

### Collaboration on AI Watch with Issa

I will be discussing AI Watch further with Issa once Org Watch is caught up with.

### Work on timelines related to AI safety

This overlaps to some extent with timelines wiki work.

### AI safety subwiki setup (Q4 2023 and/or Q1 2024)

I'll decide the details regarding this after the outcome of the AI
Watch and timelines work.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Aligning my web server series

I have already published
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Efj8NCCv3TqDL5mbC/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-1-backups and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Emmvzz3xXjfH4342f/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-2-security

I have some private notes around spam and performance that I can
convert to a public draft at some point (probably after publishing the
security post).

Publishing these posts is secondary to actually doing the devops work,
but it might still be complementary in a good way, so I might end up
doing it even while the devops work is in progres.

### Tech tips series

I was previously writing stuff on wikiHow, but the level of
specialization and recent changes to wikiHow make it not a great forum
any more for the posts. So I'm thinking of writing these on LessWrong
now.

#### Public draft: Troubleshoot regressions in production systems

I have a public draft
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikihow/troubleshoot-regressions-in-production-systems.mediawiki
that needs to be converted from wikiHow-style to LessWrong-style and published.

#### Idea + private notes: debugging / getting to the bottom of something

I have some private notes related to debugging that identifies three steps:

1. Identify characteristics and try to replicate
2. Identify proximal cause
3. Identify root cause

I need to move this out of its original context (that can't be
publicly disclosed) and frame it as general problem-solving tips.

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc.

#### Public draft: how my life has improved

I have one draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md
that is worth polishing and publishing. I might get around to this in
Q4 2022 (the post is mostly ready so additional work needed to publish
it is minimal) but I might also delay it further.

#### Public draft: managing personal projects with a demanding day job

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

#### Public draft: steady states and crunch times

I wrote another draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/steady-states-and-crunch-times.md
in early March, in the context of the crunch time I was experiencing
switching jobs. However, I got some negative feedback on the post so I
decided to shelve it and revisit later. I might pick it up later.

I have thoughts on other posts but no ready-to-publish drafts that I can remember offhand.

### Posts about life hacks stuff

#### Idea + mental notes: personal finances, credit scores and credit cards (possibly two different posts)

I have an idea for a post on managing personal finances, that includes
a range of stuff including balancing money between accounts, setting
up alerts and notifications, etc.

#### Idea + mental notes + related private notes: physical caution

I also have a post about best practices for physical caution, based on
my private notes about the subject.

### Posts about job change and retrospective

#### Public draft: retrospective of my life in academia and tech (might be outdated in important ways)

I might write a few posts in 2023 or later about these topics:

* Reasons I switched to Equator/biotech, and reasons I had to leave
* Comparison of my life in academia and industry

I have one draft post at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/comparative-retrospective-of-my-life-in-academia-and-tech.md
with a comparative retrospective of academia and the tech sector.

There's no blocker really to working on this post; however, it's
somewhat lower in priority than the other personal projects work, and
I also think the post can be even more accurate after a greater
passage of time because I'll have a better sense of how things shaped
up longer-term.

### Other ideas

#### Idea: Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe Q2 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

#### Idea: COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

#### Idea: Daniel Pink MasterClass review (either before April 2022, or delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expired in early April 2022, so I probably won't finish it unless and
until I decide to get a MasterClass subscription again.

## Wikipedia editing

See
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/pages-to-create.md
for my current list (some of the articles here might already be
present or might no longer make sense to create when I actually get
around to them).

I'd like to do some Wikipedia editing occasionally to "stay in touch"
with that side of things, and to get some gratification for
contributing to something public and widely known (in contrast with
timelines wiki where the traffic to pages tends to be low even when
their quality is great).
