# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: November 28, 2020

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## DMV visit to get my state ID card renewed

I should do this ideally some time in the week of December 7 or
December 14.

## Personal finances, income and taxes updates (likely January 2021, may start in December and may continue to February)

With 2020 ending, I'll consolidate my finances for the year so that
https://finances.vipulnaik.com/ has accurate 2020 data plus some
prospective 2021 data. I'll also use the opportunity to finish the
bulk of the legwork for filing my 2020 US federal and California state
income tax.

I may also use the occasion to finish some backfilling related to my
personal finances, though I might also do that earlier or later.

**How much time might this take?**: Probably 5 to 12 hours, spread over
a few weekends.

**How optimized and how repeated is this?**: Other than the
backfilling portion, I expect the rest of the process to be the kind
of work that I will do every year while I'm in a situation like my
current one. I believe I've already exhausted most
optimization/streamlining opportunities that passed a cost-benefit
analysis.

## Physical possessions downsizing (December 2020 if I get some free time, otherwise January/February 2021 after finances/taxes stuff)

I would like the task of moving from one house to another to be less
daunting, thereby making it easier for me to think of changing my
residence. For this, I would like to slowly downsize physical
posesssions other than toiletries and stationery (which are probably
ok to leave behind). Things I want to downsize:

* Paper I've used in the past, mail for others etc.
* VCDs/DVDs
* Other electronics
* Clothes that are somewhat worn out that I don't plan to wear again

I disposed of a bunch of electronics at the turn of year from 2019 to
2020; at the time, I didn't dispose of some pieces because I thought I
might come back to use them (although I hadn't used them for almost 6
years at the time). With 1 more year gone after that, it might be time
to do the next round of downsizing.

## Devops/server maintenance work (likely February/March 2021)

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).

## Revival of donations list website (DLW) (likely starting March 2021, end date unclear as it may be somewhat ongoing)

I've put DLW on hibernation for quite a long time. I need to revive it
and figure out a long-term plan for it. One component of the long-term
plan might be transitioning some pieces of the work to Sebastian, but
I want to first get back in the groove and get on top of the
situation.

## Migration stuff (likely starting March 2021, alternated with DLW)

Details unclear, but I will probably pick up from where I left off in
July 2020.

## Entertainment and self-education portal (ese.vipulnaik.com) some time in 2021

I will probably just do this at some point in 2021 when I feel like
it, but it shouldn't cause anything else important to get delayed.
