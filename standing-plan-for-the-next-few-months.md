# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: December 28, 2024

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Bucket-based and cadence-based classification of activities, and how I try to balance buckets and cadences

### Bucket classification of activities and time target philosophy by bucket

* Day job: Here, I set both minimum and maximum time targets; I need
  to hit some minimum targets to continue to be and appear useful at
  the day job, but also want to make sure I'm not spending too much
  time at the expense of other buckets.

* Personal projects: Here, I only set minimum time targets; in my
  ideal world, I would spend unlimited time on this.

* Personal finances, income and taxes: I only set maximum time
  targets; to the extent that I can streamline things enough to spend
  zero time here, that is good with me!

* Personal chores: I only set maximum time
  targets; to the extent that I can streamline things enough to spend
  zero time here, that is good with me!

* House chores: I set neither minimum nor maximum time targets, but
  may start setting maximum time targets at some point if it ends up
  being a time drain.

* Family and career planning: So far, I haven't set minimum or maximum
  time targets, but I might start setting them temporarily when
  working on focused projects in this area.

* Other activities: I don't set either minimum or maximum time
  targets.

### Cadence classification of activities

Activities can be classified as follows based on their cadence and
reminder system:

* Activities embedded in my daily routine: Note that for personal
  chores, things that are strictly part of daily routine (such as
  eating, jogging, and brushing) are not even time-tracked. For other
  buckets, they're generally time-tracked. No significant planning is
  needed for these activities.

* Activities embedded in my multi-day (less than a week) or weekly
  routine (I call these "cyclic personal chores"): Examples include
  buying groceries, cooking, and updating my daily update
  summaries. While these are generally time-tracked, they're
  sufficiently embedded in my routine that I don't generally need to
  make deliberate effort to do or remember them. Only in exceptional
  circumstances, such as ill health, time crunch, or inclement
  weather, do I need to devote planning effort to them.

  NOTE: Starting October 2024, with the implementation of [best
  practices around
  sleep](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md)
  and [best practices around exertion and
  stimulation](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation,md),
  I have been putting in some effort into making sure that I do the
  required chores early enough in the day so that I am not forced to
  stay up late for timing reasons, and also making sure that I don't
  try doing too many activities of various kinds in the same day that
  might fatigue me. This has meant a bit more planning is needed than
  was previously needed. But still, I don't need to plan just to
  remember to do these activities, it's more about the scheduling
  adjustment.

* Small activities that arise due to "incoming" signals: This includes
  responding to email messages, alerts (whether at work or for my
  personal servers). As I have reasonable routines for keeping an eye
  on incoming signals, and the actions to take (once I do receive the
  signals) are generally straightforward, I generally don't need to
  put in deliberate effort to do these.

* Activities that are part of monthly checklists, such as contract
  work payment updates, monthly balance updates, etc. Some portion of
  the month change checklist is publicly available
  [here](month-change-checklist.md).

* Periodic activities that are less frequent than once in 1-2 months,
  that are generally managed through calendar reminders. These may
  include things like refilling balances, expiration dates for
  long-lasting foods and medicines, checking the condition of some
  equipment, etc.

* One-time projects: Examples here include things like server
  migration, automating something, making development improvements to
  a repository, etc. If these are one-shot tasks, that can be done in
  one or two sittings, I may use calendar reminders to nudge myself to
  do them around some time. For more complex tasks, I generally do
  them in smaller increments. For personal projects, to address a
  problem of insufficient progress, I started around March/April 2024
  to manage these increments by using weekly issues that record what I
  intend to do in personal projects this week; this was successful in
  getting things moving, but I did not continue the practice once
  things got moving.

* Ongoing tasks with no set required cadence and a lot of time
  flexibility: Examples include DLW data entry, Wikipedia work,
  etc. Generally, there's no minimum or maximum amount that has to be
  done in a given week, and it makes sense to do more or less
  depending on my mood and time availability.

I've had a general sense that I spend less time than I should on the
last two candece categories: one-time pojects and ongoing tasks with
no set required cadence and a lot of time flexibility. My broad
solutions are as follows:

* Some things can be moved to the other cadence categories. For
  instance, ongoing tasks with no set cadence can be given an
  artificial set cadence and then moved to a month change checklist.

  However, I don't want to overdo this, as a lot of the joy and flow
  with these tasks comes from the variability and spontaneity in the
  task construction, as well as the open-endedness of how much to work
  on it. Adding it to yet another TODO item on the already-fairly-long
  month change checklist won't work.

* Starting mid-October 2024, I am planning to focus the weekends on
  personal projects, by placing strict limits on day job and some
  personal chores tasks, if my overall time budget allows for it. This
  focus will likely mean more of a focus on these two cadence
  categories within personal projects.

* Weekly issues where I outline roughly what I plan to do in these
  buckets, particularly for personal projects: I started doing this
  around March/April 2024, but had effectively abandoned this by Q4
  2024. However, it's something I might resume in the future.

## Work situation

### General plan outside of the special circumstances of Q1 and Q2 2025

Special circumstances apply to Q1 and Q2 2025. The description below
applies to my steady state outside of those times.

* I will be work-focused on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, though I
  might still take out time for time-sensitive personal chores
  (including all cyclic personal chores). I aim to spend at least 2
  focused hours per day on average over these three days; however, in
  many cases I may end up spending way more than 2 hours on one of the
  days and less on others.

* I will try to be responsive on Slack and work email on Wednesday and
  Friday. I expect that *de facto* I'll end up spending 30-60 minutes
  per day on these days, but I will not be *trying* to spend time at
  work on these days.

  On weeks where I have to take time off on Monday, Tuesday, and
  Thursday for personal chores or time-sensitive stuff in personal
  projects, I'll usually compensate by spending a little more time for
  work on Wednesday and Friday.

* On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), my focus will be on things
  other than the day job.

  By default, my day job work during weekends will *only* be on tasks
  like these:

  * Attending to incoming stuff such as emails, Slack messages,
    on-call alerts, and build failures, and making *small* adjustments
    and fixes based on these (where it's easier to just make the
    adjustment rather than add it to a list to do later).

  * Continuing to monitor or push forward any threads started during
    the week, particularly for cases where small durations of effort
    can help keep pushing things forward. An example is running a
    series of jobs where I have to trigger the next job after the
    previous job finished.

  * Working on a task where there is a lot of time-sensitivity to the
    completion of the task.

  * Working on a task where there are significant continuity benefits
    to working on the task now (for instance, there's a lot of context
    built up from working on it during the week).

  Any work I do above and beyond the above should be *only* for one of
  these reasons:

  * I need to work on the weekend to meet my absolute minimum weekly
    target (see below).

  * I need to work on the weekend to meet my conditional minimum
    weekly target (see below) *and* I have either already achieved or
    am on track to achieve my personal projects conditional minimum
    weekly target. In cases where I have achieved my absolute minimum
    weekly target for day job, but not my conditional minimum weekly
    target, and I'm also not clearly on track to meeting my
    conditional minimum weekly target for personal projects, I should
    give priority to getting on track with personal projects.

  * I have already exceeded my minimum target on personal projects for
    the week by at least 2 hours, and spending time on day job over
    the weekend will not put me significantly behind on any non-work
    tasks (whether personal projects, personal finances, personal
    chores, or anything else).

* I aim to follow these *absolute minimum* weekly targets:

  * At least 4 hours 30 minutes on weeks that I do not have any day
    off of my three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a
    company holiday)

  * At least 3 hours on weeks that I have one day off of my
    three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a company
    holiday)

  * At least 1 hour 30 minutes on weeks that I have marked two days
    off of my three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a
    company holiday)

* I aim to follow these *conditional minimum* weekly targets: *at
  least one* of the following must be true:

  * At least 7 hours in the week
  * At least 7.25 hours average (21.75 hours total) across that week and
    the two preceding weeks
  * At least 7.5 hours average (37.5 hours total) across that week and
    the four preceding weeks
  * At least 7.75 hours average (54.25 hours total) across that week
    and the six preceding weeks
  * At least 8 hours average (72 hours total) across that week and the
    eight preceding weeks

* ADDED 2024-11-17, UPDATED 2024-12-01: For work I do under personal
  projects or other activities that makes me more familiar with
  technologies or systems that I use at work, and where the knowledge
  is potentially useful to work, I can count 50% of that time (limit
  of 2.5 hours per week for after applying the 50%, so effectively up
  to 5 hours per week) toward my conditional minimum but not toward my
  absolute minimum. For instance, if I spend 5 hours in the week on
  day job and 4 hours on learning about stuff related to browsers or
  website speed (stuff that may be useful to my day job) I can count
  half of that 4 hours (2 hours) toward my conditional minimum, with a
  total of 5 + 2 = 7 hours, meeting my conditional minimum of 7 hours
  for day job.

* I aim to follow these *conditional maximum* weekly targets: *at
  least one* of the following must be true:

  * At most 14 hours in the week
  * At most 13.75 hours average (41.25 hours total) across that week and
    the two preceding weeks
  * At most 13.5 hours average (67.5 hours total) across that week and the
    four preceding weeks

### Adjusted schedule within Q1 and Q2 of 2025

Details still need to be worked on, as I don't have full clarity on
the responsibilities and how hectic things will be. Here is my current
plan.

#### For the period until 2025-01-26

Everything remains the same as usual, with the exception that I lift
the restrictions against doing work on Wednesdays, Fridays, and
weekends. This is because it may be strategically wise to do work on
the weekends to clear my plate of things ahead of the increased
hours. Additional hours accumulated this way can also be used to
smooth out / cancel against the increased hours requirements in future
weeks.

#### For the period from 2025-01-27 to 2025-04-20

* (no change from the usual) I will be work-focused on Monday,
  Tuesday, and Thursday, though I might still take out time for
  time-sensitive personal chores (including all cyclic personal
  chores). I aim to spend at least 2 focused hours per day on average
  over these three days; however, in many cases I may end up spending
  way more than 2 hours on one of the days and less on others.

* (change on the LiftIgniter side of things) On Wednesday and Friday,
  my focus within work will be on things related to LiftIgniter
  customers and infrastructure. Outside of these, I will try to be
  responsive on Slack and work email on Wednesday and Friday, but will
  not be pursuing active work unless time-sensitive.

* (change in terms of being more relaxed) For the weekends, while I
  will aspire to follow the same rules as before, I'll be a bit looser
  in terms of allowing myself to do work that I expect will put me in
  a better position for coming weeks.

* (thresholds multiplied by 1.5) I aim to follow these *absolute
  minimum* weekly targets:

  * At least 6 hours 45 minutes on weeks that I do not have any day
    off of my three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a
    company holiday)

  * At least 4 hours 30 minutes on weeks that I have one day off of my
    three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a company
    holiday)

  * At least 2 hours 15 minutes on weeks that I have marked two days
    off of my three working days (either marked as PTO by me or a
    company holiday)

* (thresholds multiplied by 1.5 (approx)) I aim to follow these *conditional
  minimum* weekly targets: *at least one* of the following must be
  true:

  * At least 10.5 hours in the week

  * At least 10.75 hours average (32.25 hours total) across that week
    and the two preceding weeks

  * At least 11 hours average (55 hours total) across that week and
    the four preceding weeks

  * At least 11.25 hours average (78.75 hours total) across that week
    and the six preceding weeks

  * At least 11.5 hours average (92 hours total) across that week and
    the eight preceding weeks

  * NOTE: Early on during this period, there will be weeks where the
    prior 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks (for the above conditions) will be
    partly or fully before the period of increased hours. In such
    cases, add 3.5 hours per week to the hours for those weeks when
    doing the calculation. Similarly, when coming off this period,
    subtract 3.5 hours per week when including weeks within this
    period for a final week after this period.

* (thresholds multiplied by 1.5 (approx)) I aim to follow these
  *conditional maximum* weekly targets: *at least one* of the
  following must be true:

  * At most 21 hours in the week
  * At most 20.75 hours average (62.25 hours total) across that week and
    the two preceding weeks
  * At most 20.5 hours average (102.5 hours total) across that week and the
    four preceding weeks

#### For the period 2025-04-21 onward

My tentative plan is to return to normal number of hours. The
distribution between days is subject to some tweaking.

## Target time distribution between personal projects, personal finances, personal chores, etc.

### General plan outside of the special circumstances of Q1 and Q2 2025

* I aim to follow this *conditional minimum* target each week for
  personal projects; *at least one* of the following must be true:
  * At least 4 hours on personal projects in that week
  * At least 4.25 hours average (12.75 hours total) on personal
    projects across that week and the two preceding weeks
  * At least 4.5 hours average (22.5 hours total) on personal projects
    across that week and the four preceding weeks
  * At least 4.75 hours average (33.25 hours total) on personal
    projects across that week and the six preceding weeks
  * At least 5 hours average (45 hours total) on personal projects
    across that week and the eight preceding weeks

  These conditional minimum targets were suspended during my India
  trip and for the first few weeks after returning from India. They
  take effect again *starting the week of 2024-04-08*.

  The following are some situations where these targets may be
  suspended:

  * The week of a work trip (for instance, my trip to Portland
    2024-06-03 to 2024-06-07)

  * The week of intercity or international travel, as well as the week
    prior to it if the travel starts early in the week (Wednesday or
    sooner)

  * The week after intercity or international travel

  * Up to two weeks prior to travel that was not planned more than
    three weeks in advance (for instance my Portland trip)

  The following is a situation where the target may be relaxed or
  substituted: if I'm doing significant one-off "building" work that
  falls under personal finances or personal chores, I can count the
  one-off "building" work towards the target. Some examples include:

  * Setting up data structures and verification queries related to
    taxes, that I expect to be useful over more than just one year

  * Refining my travel-related checklists and doing related research

  * Doing setup work related to nutrition recording (this does not
    include ongoing updates to the data -- just the setup portions of
    the work)

  Another situation where the target may be relaxed or substituted: if
  I spend over three hours in a week on one-off catchups (excluding
  weekly catchup with parents), then the excess time I spend over
  three hours can be substituted for personal projects time as far as
  meeting the thresholds is concerned (officially, unless directly
  tied to personal projects, this time would still be counted in the
  other activities bucket). The idea here is that sometimes these
  catchups can be lengthy as it makes sense to spend a lot of
  contiguous time, but they are also relatively rare.

  However, I cannot avail of these exceptions too often -- I haven't
  thought of a limit but, for instance, more than four weeks in a
  quarter would be excessive, and ideally these exceptions should
  happen about once a quarter or less. Ideally even in the weeks where
  I'm doing some work of the above sorts, my personal projects time
  should still exceed the threshold for that week or using a
  three-week or five-week average.

* I aim to follow this *conditional maximum* target each week for
  personal chores: *at least one* of the following must be true:
  * At most 13 hours on personal chores in that week
  * At most 12.5 hours average (37.5 hours total) on personal
    chores across that week and the two preceding weeks
  * At most 12 hours average (60 hours total) on personal chores
    across that week and the four preceding weeks

* I aim to follow this *conditional maximum* target each week for
  personal finances, income and taxes: *at least one* of the following
  must be true:
  * At most 3 hours on personal finances, income and taxes in that week
  * At most 2.5 hours average (7.5 hours total) on personal
    finances, income and taxes across that week and the two preceding
    weeks
  * At most 2 hours average (10 hours total) on personal finances,
    income and taxes across that week and the four preceding weeks

* Aspirationally, on the weekends, I also aim to follow these
  additional guidelines regarding personal chores.

  * I should of course continue to do all time-sensitive personal
    chores that fall on the weekend, including cooking, food
    purchases, and laundry, but should generally try where possible to
    schedule them during the weekday if it's close to neutral as far
    as the availability cycle considerations go.

  * For month change checklist items that fall under personal chores,
    where possible, I should complete them during the weekdays, using
    Wednesday and Friday for the cases where those items require
    longer chunks of time. I should do parts of them on the weekend
    only if one of these conditions hold:

    * I wasn't able to do them during the weekdays (due to things being
      busy), *and* it's not feasible to defer them to next week
      (either because they need to be done sooner, or because next
      week is also expected to be busy).

    * The totality of time I need to spend is relatively small, and
      the closure benefits are high, or there are other considerations
      that make it efficient to spend that time on the weekend.

    * My mood/fatigue levels don't allow me to spend time on personal
      projects or other higher-value things.

    * I have exceeded the conditional minimum for personal projects
      for the week by at least 2 hours.

    NOTE: For personal chores tasks that are at a quarterly or lower
    frequency, it's fine to do them on weekends even under ordinary
    conditions, but I should still consider shifting them around (to
    the extent that there's flexibility) and make sure to both meet my
    conditional minimum on personal projects *and* get the
    uninterrupted time for the kinds of tasks within personal projects
    that benefit from such time.

  * For non-scheduled/exploratory building and research work on my
    health, that falls under personal chores, I should try as much as
    possible to do them during the week, particularly on Wednesday and
    Friday in cases where they need longer chunks of time. I should do
    them during the weekend only in case they are time-sensitive and I
    was not able to complete them prior, or if I have exceeded the
    conditional minimum for personal projects for the week by at least
    2 hours.

  The goal with these restrictions is to keep the weekend, as much as
  possible, focused on personal projects, and not dilute or divert my
  energy and mindshare to things that aren't time-sensitive. With
  proper planning, exploratory health work should not *become*
  time-sensitive in most cases.

  If I *do* have to do some of these tasks during the weekend, I
  should, where possible, limit them to the end of the day so that
  they don't set the tone for the rest of the day, and don't prevent
  me from getting in the flow of personal projects work.

  For now, it's still fine to continue to spend time with meals
  etc. on medical education, that falls under the other activities
  bucket. However, I may decide to pause this on weekends as well if I
  feel that it's interfering with the mindshare I'd like to give to
  personal projects.

### Adjusted schedule within Q1 and Q2 of 2025

* I am completely pausing any conditional minimum for personal
  projects until 2025-04-20. After that, I will likely introduce a
  conditional minimum at about half the normal conditional minimum
  level.

  However, my goal is to continue to stay on top of personal projects
  to the extent needed in terms of obligations and promises to others,
  while also trying to limit the extent of such obligations.

* I continue to maintain conditional maximum targets for personal
  chores and personal finances.

* I am abandoning restrictions on personal chores tasks for the
  weekend. This will allow me to handle overflows to the weekend of
  personal chores tasks, while also positioning me better to
  proactively complete personal chores tasks sooner rather than later
  in anticipation of hard-to-predict busyness at work.

## Chores to catch up on

### Electronics stuff

- [ ] Targeting for Q2 2025: Dispose of old cellphone, its swollen original battery, and its probably-not-well-functioning replacement battery

### Health stuff

- [ ] Targeting for Q2 2025: Get next round of blood tests done
- [ ] Targeting for Q2 2025: Get DEXA scan done

## Devops stuff

#### MediaWiki upgrades (Q1 or Q2 of 2025)

I should do a round of MediaWiki upgrades in Q1 or Q2 of 2025, and
also make sure the upgrade process is as streamlined as possible.

### Digital will (likely Q2 2025)

After the more cleaned-up state I create with the server migration,
I'd like to revisit my digital will and restructure it in a way that
is more robust.

## Subwiki stuff

### Editing of subwikis (Q2 2025 onward)

I plan to do off-and-on editing of the following subwikis: learning,
calculus, market, and cellbio. These wikis are all strategic:

* The learning subwiki has various meta benefits -- better
  understanding of learning can influence my strategy around subwikis
  and other things in life.

* The calculus subwiki has the benefit of being in an area where I am
  very knowledgeable that *also* has a sufficiently wide audience that
  I can get feedback from others (unlike groupprops where it's hard to
  get feedback). So, I can use it to experiment with various formats
  for data presentation and organization that can then be propagated
  to other areas.

* The cellbio subwiki is a subwiki in an area I am somewhat
  knowledgeable about but not too knowledgeable about, so it is an
  example where I can combine learning and knowledge organization, and
  judge how good the subwiki format would be in a domain such as
  biology. I'm also excited to learn more about cellbio, so it serves
  a dual function of addressing my learning need.

* The market subwiki is exciting because of my historical interest in
  economics and thinking about the world from a market lens.

I might also pick up more higher-math-wiki editing, covering wikis
such as groupprops, topospaces, commalg, and diffgeom, but this is
likely to come a little later.

### Setting up additional subwikis starting Q2 2025 or so (deferred until after the server migration is complete)

Once I have streamlined by subwiki setup process and moved to a new
server, I'll streamline the process for setting up brand *new*
subwikis, and then set up additional subwikis. One such possibility is
an AI safety subwiki. I am also exploring the possibility of various
health-related subwikis.

While there may be more subwikis to add, I expect that the process
will get streamlined more and more and the incremental effort of
adding new subwikis will be low.

## Food portal (likely Q2 2025)

I added a bunch of food purchases verification queries in Q1 2024; see
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/python/food_purchases_verification_queries.py)
for details. I continued working on these in Q2 and then also started
recording food preparations and openings, and started building out
associated verification queries, all as part of [issue
7](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/issues/7).

The system of verification queries is working well for flagging
short-run issues. However, it's still a little difficult to look at
the data and understand longer-run trends. Since Q1 2025 is expected
to be busy, my tentative plan is to slot the food portal work for Q2
2025.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) starting Q2 2025

I resumed DLW data entry work to some extent in Q4 2023 and then
paused it in Q1 2024 to focus on my India trip. I did a little bit of
work in Q1 2024, then paused to focus on the server migration. With
the server migration completed in Q4 2024, my attention was divided
between several tasks for the rest of Q4, and then Q1 2025 is expected
to be busy with work.

While I have a lot to catch up with on DLW to begin with, I don't yet
have a clear sense of what the steady-state ongoing work level will be
once I have caught up.

However, I do intend to put a lot of focus on this starting around Q2
2025 and then moving forward.

## Timelines wiki work

### Getting and staying on top of "Timelines I keep expanding regularly" (Q1 2025 and onward)

See
[here](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Vipul#Timelines_I_keep_expanding_regularly_.28or_at_least.2C_aim_to.21.29)
for details.

I made some progress on this in Q3 2024, but at some point switched
focus to finishing the server migration work. Q4 2024 was a bit busy
with stuff and I wasn't able to make as much progress as I would have
liked. This is something that is not super-time-intensive (as of end
of 2024, only one timeline is out of date) so I expect to be on top of
this in Q1 2025 and going forward.

### Work that has synergies with DLW work, and resultant EA Forum posts in 2024 or later

I want to work on a bunch of timelines in the timelines wiki that have
synergies with the work I'm doing on DLW. While doing this, the
synergistic work will also give rise to ideas that I might develop
into EA Forum posts.

### Meta work

Another side-effect of the above-mentioned work on timelines wiki will
be more updates on general practices with timelines wiki, that I plan
to then share with Sebastian and help inform his work as well. I also
plan to make active efforts to articulate meta policies in
collaboration with Issa and Sebastian.

## Family and career planning work (planning to resume Q3 2025)

I want to think systematically about plans for family and career. In
Q4 2023 I started writing (private) notes documenting my thoughts on a
variety of aspects of this. I'm planning to start picking this up more
in Q3 2025, once my increased work has ended and I have picked my
personal projects back up.

## More reading/learning around AI safety

### Collaboration on AI Watch with Issa

I will be discussing AI Watch further with Issa once Org Watch is caught up with.

### Work on timelines related to AI safety

This overlaps to some extent with timelines wiki work.

### AI safety subwiki setup (Q2 2025 or later)

I'll decide the details regarding this after the outcome of the AI
Watch and timelines work.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Aligning my web server series

I have already published
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Efj8NCCv3TqDL5mbC/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-1-backups and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Emmvzz3xXjfH4342f/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-2-security

I have some private notes around spam and performance that I can
convert to a public draft at some point (probably after publishing the
security post).

Publishing these posts is secondary to actually doing the devops work,
but it might still be complementary in a good way, so I might end up
doing it even while the devops work is in progres.

### Tech tips series

I was previously writing stuff on wikiHow, but the level of
specialization and recent changes to wikiHow make it not a great forum
any more for the posts. So I'm thinking of writing these on LessWrong
now.

#### Public draft: Troubleshoot regressions in production systems

I have a public draft
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikihow/troubleshoot-regressions-in-production-systems.mediawiki
that needs to be converted from wikiHow-style to LessWrong-style and published.

#### Idea + private notes: debugging / getting to the bottom of something

I have some private notes related to debugging that identifies three steps:

1. Identify characteristics and try to replicate
2. Identify proximal cause
3. Identify root cause

I need to move this out of its original context (that can't be
publicly disclosed) and frame it as general problem-solving tips.

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc.

#### Public draft: how my life has improved

I have one draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md
that is worth polishing and publishing. I might get around to this in
Q4 2022 (the post is mostly ready so additional work needed to publish
it is minimal) but I might also delay it further.

#### Public draft: managing personal projects with a demanding day job

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

#### Public draft: steady states and crunch times

I wrote another draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/steady-states-and-crunch-times.md
in early March, in the context of the crunch time I was experiencing
switching jobs. However, I got some negative feedback on the post so I
decided to shelve it and revisit later. I might pick it up later.

I have thoughts on other posts but no ready-to-publish drafts that I can remember offhand.

### Posts about life hacks stuff

#### Idea + mental notes: personal finances, credit scores and credit cards (possibly two different posts)

I have an idea for a post on managing personal finances, that includes
a range of stuff including balancing money between accounts, setting
up alerts and notifications, etc.

#### Idea + mental notes + related private notes: physical caution

I also have a post about best practices for physical caution, based on
my private notes about the subject.

### Posts about job change and retrospective

#### Public draft: retrospective of my life in academia and tech (might be outdated in important ways)

I might write a few posts in 2023 or later about these topics:

* Reasons I switched to Equator/biotech, and reasons I had to leave
* Comparison of my life in academia and industry

I have one draft post at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/comparative-retrospective-of-my-life-in-academia-and-tech.md
with a comparative retrospective of academia and the tech sector.

There's no blocker really to working on this post; however, it's
somewhat lower in priority than the other personal projects work, and
I also think the post can be even more accurate after a greater
passage of time because I'll have a better sense of how things shaped
up longer-term.

### Other ideas

#### Idea: Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

#### Idea: Daniel Pink MasterClass review (delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription, if I ever do it)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expired in early April 2022, so I probably won't finish it unless and
until I decide to get a MasterClass subscription again.

## Wikipedia editing

See
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/pages-to-create.md
for my current list (some of the articles here might already be
present or might no longer make sense to create when I actually get
around to them).

I'd like to do some Wikipedia editing occasionally to "stay in touch"
with that side of things, and to get some gratification for
contributing to something public and widely known (in contrast with
timelines wiki where the traffic to pages tends to be low even when
their quality is great).
