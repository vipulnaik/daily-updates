# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: September 18, 2022

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Summary by quarter

My standing plan is pretty concrete (and packed) until Q2
2023. There's a bit of open space in Q3 2023 and Q4 2023, and things
are wide open starting 2024.

Quarter | Primary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Secondary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Side things, such as blog posts
-- | -- | -- | --
Q4 2022 | Devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time) | Family planning, Timelines wiki complementary and meta work | [How my life has improved](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md), rapid checklists post
Q1 2023 | Devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time), Google Analytics migration (one-time) | Family planning, DLW data entry, Timelines wiki complementary and meta work | [Comparative retrospective of my life in academia and tech](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/comparative-retrospective-of-my-life-in-academia-and-tech.md)
Q2 2023 | Setting up new subwikis, DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work | [Managing personal projects with a demanding day job](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md), EA Hotel retrospective post
Q3 2023 | DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects (such as stuff related to cause prioritization, Diet Watch, CDP, devec, etc.) | COVID-19 forecasts retrospective post; probably several other posts, as my DLW data entry and timelines wiki work will generate several ideas
Q4 2023 | DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects | Probably several posts, as my DLW data entry and timelines wiki work will generate several ideas

## Work situation

My work situation got a little complicated between Q1 and Q3 2022, but
I expect it to straighten out and reach a more manageable steady state
by Q4 2022.

The background is that I embarked on a job transition. I started
splitting time between my existing job at LiftIgniter / Maven and a
new job at Equator Therapeutics starting April 19, 2022, but in fact I
informally started getting on top of what's going on at Equator
starting February 2022. I'm planning to transition to being full-time
at Equator starting October 1, 2022, so my last day at LiftIgniter /
Maven will be September 30, 2022.

The multiple-job situation as well as the knowledge transition work
led to things being more busy, but by Q4 things will be closer to a
normal steady state.

## House move

I moved house in April 2022. This led to a fair amount of work during
April/May, and some residual work. Since Q3 2022 has been a little
busy with job transition, I'm planning to catch up with these residual
items in Q4 2022. The three main pieces of work that remain are:

* Week of October 31: Getting a vacuum cleaner
* Week of November 14: Getting a new pillow (not directly related to
  the house move, but overdue)

The current week allocations are somewhat arbitrary, and I might defer
these items further depending on my busyness, weather conditions, and
other factors. I expect to get annual vaccines in November and
possibly get my eye checkup some time in November too, so from a
smoothing perspective it seems better to get through these house move
items in October.

## Devops/server maintenance work through 2022 and early 2023

### Server migration (Q4 2022 and Q1 2023): mostly one-time

I'm trying to get to a point where I have a clean recipe (comprised of
scripts) that I can use to set up a server for all my websites. This
could be helpful as it makes my devops setup less snowflakey, and
allows for easier upgrading and quicker recovery against various kinds
of catastrophes (including accidental data deletion, hardware failure,
and malware attacks).

My current hope and plan is to wrap this up in 2022. I've written up a
gameplan but due to potential vulnerabilities I'm not sharing the
gameplan publicly. At a high level, though, I plan to get all the
non-MediaWiki stuff fully done in Q4 2022 (most of it is already
prepared as of Q3 2022) and finish up the MediaWiki portion by Q1
2023. The MediaWiki portion is a little more challenging insofar as
multiple rounds of upgrades are needed, and I'm also waiting for
MediaWiki to officially support the new version of PHP.

**The ongoing burden of this work after Q1 2023 will be fairly
low**. This can be thought of as mostly one-time work owing to the
snowflakey work I approached server setup and maintenance in the last
decade. So this is a one-time improvement/fix. However, I do plan to
budget a little bit of time on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis
making sure that things are in order, and I might upgrade my OS every
two years as a matter of course.

### Google Analytics migration in Q1 2023: mostly one-time

The Google Analytics migration has a hard deadline of June 30, 2023,
so I should try to get it switched over in Q1 2023. I might have to do
it on the old server if I have not yet moved over to the new server by
then.

Google Analytics doesn't change up too often, so this is really
one-time work.

### Setting up additional subwikis in Q2 2023

Once I have streamlined by subwiki setup process and moved to a new
server, I'll streamline the process for setting up brand *new*
subwikis, and then set up additional subwikis. One such possibility is
an AI safety subwiki.

While there may be more subwikis to add, I expect that the process
will get streamlined more and more and the incremental effort of
adding new subwikis will be low.

## Family planning work starting Q4 2022

I want to think systematically about having a family -- the search for
a life partner, the various steps involved with having kids, and
more. I've been thinking off and on about this but haven't been
systematically documenting my thoughts. Starting in Q4 2022 I'm going
to start writing (private) notes documenting my thoughts on a variety
of aspects of this. The hope is that this could inform relevant
actions in 2023 such as searching for a partner or looking into other
life change options.

I'm probably not going to say a lot about this publicly except that
I'm thinking about the topic.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) in 2023: potentially ongoing work

I expect to start doing DLW work as time and mood permits starting Q1
2023 and continuing into 2023. However, I will be prioritizing devops
work and Google Analytics migration work over DLW work to the extent
that I feel in the mood to do devops work. So DLW work may pick up in
earnest only starting around Q2 2023.

While I have a lot to catch up with on DLW to begin with, I don't yet
have a clear sense of what the steady-state ongoing work level will be
once I have caught up.

## Timelines wiki work from Q4 2022 onward

For the most part, work on timelines will be lower-priority for me
than work on devops or DLW, but based on mood I might still end up
doing a fair amount of work on timelines.

### Work that has synergies with DLW work, and resultant EA Forum posts through late 2022 and 2023

I want to work on a bunch of timelines in the timelines wiki that have
synergies with the work I'm doing on DLW. While doing this, the
synergistic work will also give rise to ideas that I might develop
into EA Forum posts.

### Meta work

Another side-effect of the above-mentioned work on timelines wiki will
be more updates on general practices with timelines wiki, that I plan
to then share with Sebastian and help inform his work as well. I also
plan to make active efforts to articulate meta policies in
collaboration with Issa and Sebastian.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc. (probably 2023 unless I get really excited about something)

I have one draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md
that is worth polishing and publishing. I might get around to this in
Q4 2022 (the post is mostly ready so additional work needed to publish
it is minimal) but I might also delay it further.

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

I have thoughts on other posts but no ready-to-publish drafts that I can remember offhand.

### Posts about job change and retrospective

I might write a few posts in 2023 about these topics:

* Reasons I switched to Equator/biotech
* Comparison of my life in academia and industry

I have one draft post at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/comparative-retrospective-of-my-life-in-academia-and-tech.md
with a comparative retrospective of academia and the tech sector.

There's no blocker really to working on this post; however, it's
somewhat lower in priority than the other personal projects work, and
I also think the post can be even more accurate after a greater
passage of time because I'll have a better sense of how things shaped
up longer-term.

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe Q2 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

### Daniel Pink MasterClass review (either before April 2022, or delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expired in early April 2022, so I probably won't finish it unless and
until I decide to get a MasterClass subscription again.
