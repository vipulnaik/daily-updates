# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: May 6, 2023

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Summary by quarter

Quarter | Primary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Secondary focus (personal projects or other activities) | Side things, such as blog posts
-- | -- | -- | --
Q2 2023 | Devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time), Google Analytics migration (one-time) | Get Org Watch going with Sebastian, a lot of personal chores | Possibly more posts in the "aligning my web server" series (no pressure)
Q3 2023 | Finish devops/server maintenance work (mostly one-time), set up new subwikis, DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, rethinking exercise, AI safety stuff, family planning, get demography subwiki going with Sebastian | Pick whatever makes sense
Q4 2023 | DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, AI safety stuff, family planning, potentially one or more from my other projects (such as stuff related to cause prioritization, Diet Watch, CDP, devec, etc.) | Pick whatever makes sense
Q1 2024 | DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects (such as stuff related to cause prioritization, Diet Watch, CDP, devec, etc.) | Pick whatever makes sense
Q2 2024 | DLW data entry | Timelines wiki complementary and meta work, potentially one or more from my other projects | Probably several posts, as my DLW data entry and timelines wiki work will generate several ideas

## Work situation (May 2023 onward)

My work situation was in flux until about May 2023. Starting May 2023,
I'm going to stick to a mostly half-time day job routine, giving me
more time to pursue personal projects and other things.

## Chores to catch up on (as much as possible, try to finish in Q2 2023 or early Q3 2023) excluding stuff covered under devops/server maintenance

### Equator purge

Wrap up Equator stuff and purge all personal copy of Equator data.

### Finances stuff

First list (aiming to finish in May):

- [ ] Finishing up of accrued expenses for 2022 + balance reconciliation
- [ ] Personal finances issues 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- [ ] Activate my California Middle Class Tax Refund (MCTR) if applicable -- it looks like the payment should be $500 according to https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/middle-class-tax-refund/index.html?WT.mc_id=akMCTR&token=null#receive

Second list (aiming to finish in June):

- [ ] Work on 2022 tax filing

### Health stuff

- [ ] Consolidate diet planning related to wisdom tooth removal and then book the appointment(s)
- [ ] Book and get through my eye test

### House stuff

Various cleaning-related tasks around the house; it's not too dirty
but it will be good to systematically clean it.

- [ ] Fridge cleaning
- [ ] Full vacuuming and other general house cleaning
- [ ] Do a round of cleaning of stuff I don't clean often (pillow protectors, mattress protector)

### Review of family emergency information

I want to make sure that I can locate and act upon my parents'
emergency information.

### Identity stuff

- [ ] Apply for a new state ID card and switch to using that

## Devops/server maintenance work through 2023

### Google Analytics migration in Q2 2023: mostly one-time

The Google Analytics migration has a hard deadline of June 30, 2023,
so I should try to get it switched over in Q2 2023. I might have to do
it on the old server if I have not yet moved over to the new server by
then.

Google Analytics doesn't change up too often, so this is really
one-time work.

### Server migration (Q2 2023 and Q3 2023, with possibly a little bit leaking into Q4 2023): mostly one-time

I'm trying to get to a point where I have a clean recipe (comprised of
scripts) that I can use to set up a server for all my websites. This
could be helpful as it makes my devops setup less snowflakey, and
allows for easier upgrading and quicker recovery against various kinds
of catastrophes (including accidental data deletion, hardware failure,
and malware attacks).

My current hope and plan is to wrap this up by the end of Q3
2023. I've written up a gameplan but due to potential vulnerabilities
I'm not sharing the gameplan publicly. At a high level, though, I plan
to get all the non-MediaWiki stuff fully done by around July 2023, and
finish up the MediaWiki portion mostly by September 2023, with
possibly some final pieces to clean up in October/November 2023. The
MediaWiki portion is a little more challenging insofar as multiple
rounds of upgrades are needed.

**The ongoing burden of this work after Q3 2023 will be fairly
low**. This can be thought of as mostly one-time work owing to the
snowflakey work I approached server setup and maintenance in the last
decade. So this is a one-time improvement/fix. However, I do plan to
budget a little bit of time on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis
making sure that things are in order, and I might upgrade my OS every
two years as a matter of course.

### Digital will

After the more cleaned-up state I create with the server migration,
I'd like to revisit my digital will and restructure it in a way that
is more robust.

### Setting up additional subwikis in Q3/Q4 2023

External commitments: Update in September 2023 promised to person who
requested subwiki setup.

Once I have streamlined by subwiki setup process and moved to a new
server, I'll streamline the process for setting up brand *new*
subwikis, and then set up additional subwikis. One such possibility is
an AI safety subwiki.

While there may be more subwikis to add, I expect that the process
will get streamlined more and more and the incremental effort of
adding new subwikis will be low.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) in 2023: potentially ongoing work

External commitments: Update in mid-August 2023 promised to potential
collaborator/contributor.

I expect to start doing DLW work as time and mood permits starting Q3
2023 and continuing into 2024. However, I will be prioritizing devops
work and Google Analytics migration work over DLW work to the extent
that I feel in the mood to do devops work. So DLW work may pick up in
earnest only starting around Q2 2023.

While I have a lot to catch up with on DLW to begin with, I don't yet
have a clear sense of what the steady-state ongoing work level will be
once I have caught up.

## Timelines wiki work from Q4 2023 onward

For the most part, work on timelines will be lower-priority for me
than work on devops or DLW, but based on mood I might still end up
doing a fair amount of work on timelines.

### Work that has synergies with DLW work, and resultant EA Forum posts through late 2022 and 2023

I want to work on a bunch of timelines in the timelines wiki that have
synergies with the work I'm doing on DLW. While doing this, the
synergistic work will also give rise to ideas that I might develop
into EA Forum posts.

### Meta work

Another side-effect of the above-mentioned work on timelines wiki will
be more updates on general practices with timelines wiki, that I plan
to then share with Sebastian and help inform his work as well. I also
plan to make active efforts to articulate meta policies in
collaboration with Issa and Sebastian.

## Rethinking exercise

I've stuck to a reasonable routine of exercise since late 2021/early
2022, with slight modifications. I'd like to rethink my exercise
routine, including possibly adding new types of exercise and upping
the weights I lift, in Q3 2023. By that time, I expect to also have a
bit more free time, which will allow me to dive deeper and do more
experimentation.

## Family planning work starting Q3 2023

I want to think systematically about having a family -- the search for
a life partner, the various steps involved with having kids, and
more. I've been thinking off and on about this but haven't been
systematically documenting my thoughts. In Q3 2023 and Q4 2023 I'm
going to start writing (private) notes documenting my thoughts on a
variety of aspects of this. The hope is that this could inform
relevant actions in 2023 such as searching for a partner or looking
into other life change options.

I'm probably not going to say a lot about this publicly except that
I'm thinking about the topic.

## More reading/learning around AI safety

### Collaboration on AI Watch with Issa

I will be discussing AI Watch further with Issa once Org Watch is caught up with.

### Work on timelines related to AI safety

This overlaps to some extent with timelines wiki work.

### Possibly a deeper dive into AI safety

I'll decide the details regarding this after the outcome of the AI
Watch and timelines work.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Aligning my web server series

I have already published
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Efj8NCCv3TqDL5mbC/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-1-backups

I have already publicly drafted
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/aligning-my-web-server-with-devops-practices-part-2-security.md
-- need to flesh out a few more pieces

I have some private notes around spam and performance that I can
convert to a public draft at some point (probably after publishing the
security post).

Publishing these posts is secondary to actually doing the devops work,
but it might still be complementary in a good way, so I might end up
doing it even while the devops work is in progres.

### Tech tips series

I was previously writing stuff on wikiHow, but the level of
specialization and recent changes to wikiHow make it not a great forum
any more for the posts. So I'm thinking of writing these on LessWrong
now.

#### Public draft: Troubleshoot regressions in production systems

I have a public draft
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikihow/troubleshoot-regressions-in-production-systems.mediawiki
that needs to be converted from wikiHow-style to LessWrong-style and published.

#### Idea + private notes: debugging / getting to the bottom of something

I have some private notes related to debugging that identifies three steps:

1. Identify characteristics and try to replicate
2. Identify proximal cause
3. Identify root cause

I need to move this out of its original context (that can't be
publicly disclosed) and frame it as general problem-solving tips.

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc.

#### Public draft: how my life has improved

I have one draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md
that is worth polishing and publishing. I might get around to this in
Q4 2022 (the post is mostly ready so additional work needed to publish
it is minimal) but I might also delay it further.

#### Public draft: managing personal projects with a demanding day job

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

#### Public draft: steady states and crunch times

I wrote another draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/steady-states-and-crunch-times.md
in early March, in the context of the crunch time I was experiencing
switching jobs. However, I got some negative feedback on the post so I
decided to shelve it and revisit later. I might pick it up later.

I have thoughts on other posts but no ready-to-publish drafts that I can remember offhand.

### Posts about life hacks stuff

#### Idea + mental notes: personal finances, credit scores and credit cards (possibly two different posts)

I have an idea for a post on managing personal finances, that includes
a range of stuff including balancing money between accounts, setting
up alerts and notifications, etc.

#### Idea + mental notes + related private notes: physical caution

I also have a post about best practices for physical caution, based on
my private notes about the subject.

### Posts about job change and retrospective

#### Public draft: retrospective of my life in academia and tech (might be outdated in important ways)

I might write a few posts in 2023 or later about these topics:

* Reasons I switched to Equator/biotech, and reasons I had to leave
* Comparison of my life in academia and industry

I have one draft post at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/comparative-retrospective-of-my-life-in-academia-and-tech.md
with a comparative retrospective of academia and the tech sector.

There's no blocker really to working on this post; however, it's
somewhat lower in priority than the other personal projects work, and
I also think the post can be even more accurate after a greater
passage of time because I'll have a better sense of how things shaped
up longer-term.

### Other ideas

#### Idea: Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe Q2 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

#### Idea: COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

#### Idea: Daniel Pink MasterClass review (either before April 2022, or delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expired in early April 2022, so I probably won't finish it unless and
until I decide to get a MasterClass subscription again.
