# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: January 3, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Personal finances, income and taxes updates (remaining parts for January/February 2021)

I have mostly updated my 2020 personal finances
(https://finances.vipulnaik.com/) and done an initial draft of work
for my US federal income tax return. I also finished filing 2017 and
2019 amendments for US federal income tax and California state income
tax.

I'm currently waiting to get various forms officially and also for the
official USD/INR exchange rate so that I can finish the 2020 tax
filings.

**How much time might this take (remaining)?**: Probably 5 to 9 hours,
spread over a few weekends.

**How optimized and how repeated is this?**: I expect most of the
process to be the kind of work that I will do every year while I'm in
a situation like my current one. I believe I've already exhausted most
optimization/streamlining opportunities that passed a cost-benefit
analysis. With that said, I expect the extra work of filing amendments
to not be present next year.

## Physical possessions downsizing (deferred to ~July 2021 except paper mail disposal)

UPDATE January 3, 2021: In light of COVID raging, I am trying to
reduce all in-person interactions to ~zero until the COVID trend
changes sharply. For this reason, I am deferring all disposal except
paper mail disposal to ~July 2021, by which time I expect COVID to get
back to summer 2020 levels (i.e., 10% of current daily infection
rate).

I would like the task of moving from one house to another to be less
daunting, thereby making it easier for me to think of changing my
residence. For this, I would like to slowly downsize physical
posesssions other than toiletries and stationery (which are probably
ok to leave behind). Things I want to downsize:

* Paper I've used in the past, mail for others etc.
* VCDs/DVDs
* Other electronics
* Clothes that are somewhat worn out that I don't plan to wear again

I disposed of a bunch of electronics at the turn of year from 2019 to
2020; at the time, I didn't dispose of some pieces because I thought I
might come back to use them (although I hadn't used them for almost 6
years at the time). With 1 more year gone after that, it might be time
to do the next round of downsizing.

## Devops/server maintenance work (likely February/March 2021)

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).

## Revival of donations list website (DLW) (likely starting March 2021, end date unclear as it may be somewhat ongoing)

I've put DLW on hibernation for quite a long time. I need to revive it
and figure out a long-term plan for it. One component of the long-term
plan might be transitioning some pieces of the work to Sebastian, but
I want to first get back in the groove and get on top of the
situation.

## Migration stuff (likely starting March 2021, alternated with DLW)

Details unclear, but I will probably pick up from where I left off in
July 2020.
