# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: April 11, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

I am planning to go down to 75% time at work for 4 weeks in May, and
then more long-term starting August.

## Diet, exercise, and health (June 2021 onward, off and on)

### Nutrition stuff

I have set up a system for recording food purchases, but there are
various incomplete bits that I need to refine. I plan to keep updating
my food purchases and refining things when I get a chance.

### Blood tests

I started recording 2021 blood test plans at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2021-blood-test-plans.md
and plan to continue augmenting that list as I think through the
issues more.

### Other rethinking of exercise and measurement tools

I would like to start thinking about regular exercise beyond my daily
jog and crushing exercises -- basically some flexibility-type exercise
(e.g., yoga, tai chi) and possibly also weight training. I will need
to think more about this and introduce gradually.

## Revival of donations list website (DLW) (likely starting April 2021, end date unclear as it may be somewhat ongoing)

I've put DLW on hibernation for quite a long time. I need to revive it
and figure out a long-term plan for it. One component of the long-term
plan might be transitioning some pieces of the work to Sebastian, but
I want to first get back in the groove and get on top of the
situation.

## Migration stuff (likely starting May 2021, alternated with DLW)

Details unclear, but I will probably pick up from where I left off in
July 2020.

## Physical possessions downsizing (deferred to ~July 2021 except paper mail disposal)

UPDATE January 3, 2021: In light of COVID raging, I am trying to
reduce all in-person interactions to ~zero until the COVID trend
changes sharply. For this reason, I am deferring all disposal except
paper mail disposal to ~July 2021, by which time I expect COVID to get
back to summer 2020 levels (i.e., 10% of current daily infection
rate).

I would like the task of moving from one house to another to be less
daunting, thereby making it easier for me to think of changing my
residence. For this, I would like to slowly downsize physical
posesssions other than toiletries and stationery (which are probably
ok to leave behind). Things I want to downsize:

* Paper I've used in the past, mail for others etc.
* VCDs/DVDs
* Other electronics
* Clothes that are somewhat worn out that I don't plan to wear again

I disposed of a bunch of electronics at the turn of year from 2019 to
2020; at the time, I didn't dispose of some pieces because I thought I
might come back to use them (although I hadn't used them for almost 6
years at the time). With 1 more year gone after that, it might be time
to do the next round of downsizing.

## Devops/server maintenance work (deferred to ~August 2021)

UPDATE February 1, 2021: I have decided to defer this work to ~August
2021, by which time I expect to have more free time available for it.

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).
