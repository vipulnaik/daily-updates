# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: September 5, 2022

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Work situation

My work situation got a little complicated between Q1 and Q3 2022, but
I expect it to straighten out and reach a more manageable steady state
by Q4 2022.

The background is that I embarked on a job transition. I started
splitting time between my existing job at LiftIgniter / Maven and a
new job at Equator Therapeutics starting April 19, 2022, but in fact I
informally started getting on top of what's going on at Equator
starting February 2022. I'm planning to transition to being full-time
at Equator starting October 1, 2022, so my last day at LiftIgniter /
Maven will be September 30, 2022.

The multiple-job situation as well as the knowledge transition work
led to things being more busy, but by Q4 things will be closer to a
normal steady state.

## Personal practices documentation and improvement

In Q2 and part of Q3 2022, I've been focused on streamlining and
improving my personal practices. This has included a fair amount of
documentation and extensive thinking. I expect this to continue to
some extent through the rest of Q3 2022, but to get to a background
level by Q4.

The short-run effect has been to increase my time allocation to
personal chores and reduce the time allocation to work and personal
projects (relative to the counterfactual) but I expect the medium-run
effect to be neutral and the long-run effect to be in the opposite
direction. I expect the "medium-run" effect will be seen by the end of
Q4 and the "long-run" effect by mid-2023.

## House move

I moved house in April 2022. This led to a fair amount of work during
April/May, and some residual work. Since Q3 2022 has been a little
busy with job transition, I'm planning to catch up with these residual
items in Q4 2022. The three main pieces of work that remain are:

* Week of October 3: Getting a vacuum cleaner
* Week of October 10: Getting a new pillow (not directly related to
  the house move, but overdue)
* Week of October 17: Getting a new state ID card to have an easier
  address proof

The current week allocations are somewhat arbitrary, and I might defer
these items further depending on my busyness, weather conditions, and
other factors. I expect to get annual vaccines in November and
possibly get my eye checkup some time in November too, so from a
smoothing perspective it seems better to get through these house move
items in October.

## Devops/server maintenance work through 2022 and early 2023

### Server migration

I'm trying to get to a point where I have a clean recipe (comprised of
scripts) that I can use to set up a server for all my websites. This
could be helpful as it makes my devops setup less snowflakey, and
allows for easier upgrading and quicker recovery against various kinds
of catastrophes (including accidental data deletion, hardware failure,
and malware attacks).

My current hope and plan is to wrap this up in 2022. I've written up a
gameplan but due to potential vulnerabilities I'm not sharing the
gameplan publicly. At a high level, though, I plan to do the
relatively easier pieces of the gameplan in Q3 2022, and spend a fair
chunk of time between September 3 and September 11 focused on
it. Whatever harder pieces I couldn't finish in Q3, I plan to execute
on in Q4.

### Google Analytics migration in Q1 2023

The Google Analytics migration has a hard deadline of June 30, 2023,
so I should try to get it switched over in Q1 2023. I might have to do
it on the old server if I have not yet moved over to the new server by
then.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) through late 2022 and 2023

Between my increased day job work and the devops/server maintenance
work, I expect that I won't really be able to work on DLW in Q3, but
I'm hopng to start picking it up more in Q4 2022 and then through
2023.

## Timelines wiki work

### Work that has synergies with DLW work, and resultant EA Forum posts through late 2022 and 2023

I want to work on a bunch of timelines in the timelines wiki that have
synergies with the work I'm doing on DLW. While doing this, the
synergistic work will also give rise to ideas that I might develop
into EA Forum posts.

### Meta work

Another side-effect of the above-mentioned work on timelines wiki will
be more updates on general practices with timelines wiki, that I plan
to then share with Sebastian and help inform his work as well. I also
plan to make active efforts to articulate meta policies in
collaboration with Issa and Sebastian.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc. (probably 2023 unless I get really excited about something)

I recently published a few blog posts on LessWrong about well-being:

* https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rBLEiEsNxpQaqwsmJ/miscellaneous-thoughts-on-handling-a-stressful-life
* https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zeT3rHE7eu2xhmWPi/the-case-for-mental-strength
* https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psMczuJ9KbujgrgLq/entitlement-as-a-major-amplifier-of-unhappiness

I have a few more related thoughts that I might convert to posts,
since the act of writing them clarifies my own thinking as well. My
general plan is to defer this till 2023 unless I get really excited
about an idea.

I have one draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/how-my-life-has-improved.md
that is worth polishing and publishing.

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

### Posts about job change and retrospective

I might write a few posts in 2023 about these topics:

* Reasons I switched to Equator/biotech
* Comparison of my life in academia and industry

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe Q2 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

### Daniel Pink MasterClass review (either before April 2022, or delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expired in early April 2022, so I probably won't finish it unless and
until I decide to get a MasterClass subscription again.
