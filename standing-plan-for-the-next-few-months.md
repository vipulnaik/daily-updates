# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: February 9, 2022

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) through 2022

For much of the second half of 2021, I resumed work on the donations
list website (DLW). I plan to continue focusing on this through the
first half of 2022, and expect to reevaluate around June 2022 how I
want to continue. Most likely I will continue to have this as a
primary focus for most of 2022.

## Devops/server maintenance work through 2022

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).

I initially expected to focus on this in Q1 2022, but due to my need
to spend larger amounts of time on other things during Q1 2022, I have
decided to spread this out over 2022, so I can opportunistically pick
it up in the relevant parts of the year.

## Migration-related stuff

I'm probably going to continue a few threads of shallow investigation
related to migration stuff in Q1 2022, and may either continue at the
same pace in Q2 and later, or focus more at some point. This is not
intended to be a focus area for Q1 2022.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Posts about mental strength, stress, coping etc.

I recently published two blog posts on LessWrong about well-being:

* https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rBLEiEsNxpQaqwsmJ/miscellaneous-thoughts-on-handling-a-stressful-life
* https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zeT3rHE7eu2xhmWPi/the-case-for-mental-strength

I have a few more related thoughts that I might convert to posts,
since the act of writing them clarifies my own thinking as well.

I also wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. I might want to revive it and update it, but probably
that won't happen till 2023.

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe late 2022 or 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

### Daniel Pink MasterClass review (either before April 2022, or delayed till I renew my MasterClass subscription)

I started writing a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/lesswrong/daniel-pink-sales-and-persuasion-masterclass-review.md
reviewing Daniel Pink's MasterClass. My MasterClass subscription
expires in early April 2022, so I should either finish the post before
that, or defer it till if/when I resume my MasterClass
subscription. I'm not too attached to getting this post out, so I'm
okay with effectively delaying this post or even never doing it, if
for whatever reason I don't get to it by the time my MasterClass
subscription expires. The MasterClass subscription cost ($180) is
nontrivial but not back-breaking, so it's possible that in the future,
my desire to finish the post might make me resume the subscription a
little bit earlier than I otherwise might have.
