# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: November 18, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

I started going down to 75% time at work mostly starting July, with a
little bit of a trial period in the period of April to June (most of
it during late May / early June).

## Diet, exercise, and health (November 2021 onward, off and on)

### Post-periodontal therapy review and possible wisdom tooth removal

In my [dental cleaning trip of August
11](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2021-08-11-dental-cleaning-trip.md)
I was recommended a course of periodontal therapy. My two appointments
happened on September 29 and October 6. I have a followup care
appointment scheduled for December 15. After that, we may proceed to
the phase 2 treatment that is wisdom tooth removal.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW)

I have successfully resumed work on the donations list website (DLW)
and expect to continue on it till at least the end of September, and
probably till the end of 2021.

## Continuation of migration stuff (alternated with DLW)

I have successfully resumed work on migration stuff, mostly in the form
of more work on migration-related timelines. I expect to continue with
this flavor of work till at least September 2021, and probably with
some form of migration-related work (this or something else) till the
end of the year.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Managing personal projects blog post (some time in 2022)

I wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. Now that I've reduced my work hours and am putting the
principles into practice, I would like to review, refine, and publish
the blog post. I expect to do so not before 2022, which should give me
enough experience actually applying the ideas over a time period where
I'm devoting a significant chunk of time to personal projects.

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, any time in the next several months)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly mid-2022 but could be earlier)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.

## Devops/server maintenance work (deferred to ~January 2022)

UPDATE July 28, 2021: I have decided to defer this work to ~January
2022, by which time I expect to have more free time available for it.

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).
