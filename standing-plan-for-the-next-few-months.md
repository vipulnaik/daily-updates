# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: January 1, 2022

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

## Continuation of donations list website (DLW) through 2022

For much of the second half of 2021, I resummed work on the donations
list website (DLW). I plan to continue focusing on this through the
first hal of 2022, and expect to reevaluate around June 2022 how I
want to continue. Most likely I will continue to have this as a
primary focus for most of 2022.

## Devops/server maintenance work (Q1 2022 and maybe more)

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).

I expect to focus on this in Q1 2022, particularly during extended
holiday periods. DLW work can fit better into shorter periods, so that
kind of division of labor makes sense.

## Migration-related stuff

I'm probably going to continue a few threads of shallow investigation
related to migration stuff in Q1 2022, and may either continue at the
same pace in Q2 and later, or focus more at some point. This is not
intended to be a focus area for Q1 2022.

## Getting out some blog posts and corresponding background work

### Managing personal projects blog post (some time in late 2022 or 2023)

I wrote a draft post
https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/blog/managing-personal-projects-with-a-demanding-day-job.md
back in 2020. Now that I've reduced my work hours and am putting the
principles into practice, I would like to review, refine, and publish
the blog post. I expect to do so not before late 2022, which should
give me enough experience actually applying the ideas over a time
period where I'm devoting a significant chunk of time to personal
projects.

### Retrospective post on EA Hotel donation (no specific timeline, maybe late 2022 or 2023)

I would like to write a retrospective of my [EA Hotel
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BM2DYWpM6rSxyZ7AS/my-q1-2019-ea-hotel-donation). I
might do this any time in the coming months, possibly during or after
various DLW updates when I feel in the mood.

I think this retrospective will be useful as an effective review of
the EA Hotel, but its bigger utility to me (and others) is in the
evaluation of donations to small organizations with potential. It
would be cool to do this before my next donation, but it's not a
blocker.

### COVID-19 forecasts retrospective (timing unclear; possibly 2023 or 2024)

I plan to write a retrospective of my [COVID-19 forecasts
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when). The
resurgence of the delta strain led me to decide to defer work on this
retrospective. I think mid-2022 will be a good time, but I might
choose an earlier or later time depending on how COVID-19 evolves.
