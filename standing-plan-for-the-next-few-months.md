# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: May 30, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

I am planning to go down to 75% time at work mostly starting July,
with a little bit of a trial period in the period of April to June.

## Diet, exercise, and health (May/June 2021 onward, off and on)

### COVID vaccines

I got my first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot on Thursday, May 27, 2021,
and have my second shot scheduled for Friday, June 24, 2021.

### Blood tests

I started recording 2021 blood test plans at
https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2021-blood-test-plans.md
and plan to continue augmenting that list as I think through the
issues more.

### Other rethinking of exercise and measurement tools

I would like to start thinking about regular exercise beyond my daily
jog and crushing exercises -- basically some flexibility-type exercise
(e.g., yoga, tai chi) and possibly also weight training. I will need
to think more about this and introduce gradually.

## Revival of donations list website (DLW) (likely starting June 2021)

I've put DLW on hibernation for quite a long time. I need to revive it
and figure out a long-term plan for it. One component of the long-term
plan might be transitioning some pieces of the work to Sebastian, but
I want to first get back in the groove and get on top of the
situation.

## Migration stuff (likely starting June 2021, alternated with DLW)

Details unclear, but I will probably pick up from where I left off in
July 2020 plus the brief exploration in the last weeek of April
2021.

## Devops/server maintenance work (deferred to ~August 2021)

UPDATE February 1, 2021: I have decided to defer this work to ~August
2021, by which time I expect to have more free time available for it.

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).
