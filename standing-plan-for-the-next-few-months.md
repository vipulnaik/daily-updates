# Standing plan for the next few months

Last major update: July 1, 2021

I use this as a living document for my standing plan for the next
months. I expect to update the document somewhere around once a month;
though possibly less frequently (once in 2 or 3 months is also
okay). My daily updates with summaries at
https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ is a more accurate record of what I
actually did, and I am more committed to keeping that up-to-date.

I start going down to 75% time at work mostly starting July, with a
little bit of a trial period in the period of April to June (most of
it during late May / early June).

## Diet, exercise, and health (July 2021 onward, off and on)

### Decision-making based on blood test results

I got a bunch of blood tests done on June 30. The results might
influence my diet and supplement decisions. I will likely spend some
time doing research and consolidation work once the results are in.

### Dentist trip

I haven't had dental cleaning done since November 2017, and haven't
had a dental checkup since a partial checkup in January 2019 in
response to a toothache. My teeth feel fine but a trip to the dentist
would be nice.

### Other rethinking of exercise and measurement tools

I would like to start thinking about regular exercise beyond my daily
jog and crushing exercises -- basically some flexibility-type exercise
(e.g., yoga, tai chi) and possibly also weight training. I will need
to think more about this and introduce gradually.

## Continuation of list website (DLW)

In late May / early June, during initial experimentation with reduced
wor hours, I picked up on DLW. I intend to continue more on DLW in
July now that I have a long-term work hours reduction to 75%. I expect
DLW to continue to be one of my focus areas for a few months.

## Continuation of migration stuff (likely starting July 2021, alternated with DLW)

Details unclear, but I will probably pick up from where I left off in
July 2020 plus the brief exploration in the last weeek of April
2021.

## Devops/server maintenance work (deferred to ~August 2021)

UPDATE February 1, 2021: I have decided to defer this work to ~August
2021, by which time I expect to have more free time available for it.

My current Linode setup, and most of my softwares and tools, were last
put together in September 2016. They need an upgrade along several
dimensions; also, I want the next iteration to be less snowflakey so
that it's easier to keep up with upgrades despite limited bandwidth. I
also want to explore cost reduction options based on [preliminary
analysis by
Issa](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/issues/6).
