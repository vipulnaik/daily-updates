# Month change checklist

To be executed on the 1st of the month, or soon after:

- [ ] `contractwork`: Update contractwork details for @riceissa and @sebastiansanchez123
- [ ] `personal-finances`: Update my balances, make sure statements are up to date, and make accrued expense updates if applicable (usually I do this only at change of quarter); also make Linode advance bill payment if applicable
- [ ] alternating months: make sure SSL/TLS certificates for Linode are updated
- [ ] `wikipediaviews`: Switch month
- [ ] `bart`: If I feel like it, update to include new months (currently I do it once every 5-6 months)

To be executed at next Monday:

- [ ] `daily-updates`: Add in a month summary along with the weekly summary work
