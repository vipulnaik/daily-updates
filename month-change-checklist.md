  - [ ] @sebastiansanchez123
  - [ ] @riceissa
  - [ ] Gabriel Bobis
  - [ ] Temporary contract worker: Tajudeen Riliwan
  - [ ] Temporary contract worker: Reagan Sang
- [ ] `personal-finances`: Update my balances, make sure statements are up to date, and make accrued expense updates if applicable (usually I do this only at change of quarter); also make Linode advance bill payment if applicable
  - Compare balances carefully between the previous month and this month to identify any unexpected balance jumps
  - Update to include contractwork payments due and payments made to:
    - [ ] @sebastiansanchez123
    - [ ] @riceissa
    - [ ] Gabriel Bobis
    - [ ] Temporary contract worker: Tajudeen Riliwan
    - [ ] Temporary contract worker: Reagan Sang
  - [ ] Check and (if necessary) update the contractwork balance of the preceding month to reflect what the contractwork portal says at https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Vipul+Naik
- [ ] Review credit scores and credit reports across all sources and save copies of them
- [ ] `wikipediaviews`: Switch month
- [ ] `bart`: Update to include the latest month (and any other months since the last update)
- [ ] `analytics-table`: Check data for all sites and see if any followup actions need to be taken, including possibly fixing broken analytics data
- [ ] `aiwatch` (for Org Watch): Check that data has been refreshed recently and run priority-based queries to see how things are going
- [ ] Timelines Wiki: Take a look at traffic trends; review my own to-do list at https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Vipul and think through the strategy

To be executed at next Monday:

- [ ] `daily-updates`: Add in a month summary along with the weekly summary work
