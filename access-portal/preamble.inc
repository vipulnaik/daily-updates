<p>This is an online portal giving a summary of updates for <a href="https://vipulnaik.com">Vipul Naik</a>. The portal code and underlying personal data are in the <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates">daily-updates GitHub repository</a>. Work-related updates are in a private repository restricted to the workplace; therefore links to work-related updates will only work correctly for co-workers.</p>

<p>Conventions: Dates are in my local timezone, which is Pacific Time for the duration covered so far. Time spent estimates are marked "N/A" for days when I did not track time spent. Time spent estimates are generally estimates of "process time" (time spent actually actively working) rather than wall-clock time, and therefore may be lower than one might expect of wall-clock time. I do not include daily-cadence tasks and chores (such as brushing my teeth, eating, cleaning dishes after eating, daily exercise) in personal chores in daily updates issues; I also generally do not include entertainment and self-education except when I deliberately took time out for it rather than multiplexing against other chores. I skip creating a personal daily update issue on days when I do nothing that I would normally put into such an issue.</p>

<p>Important dates: I started work daily updates on <a href="https://github.com/liftigniter/daily-updates/issues/2" rel="nofollow">August 10, 2018</a> and personal daily updates on <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1" rel="nofollow">October 20, 2018</a>. I plan to eventually backfill this page to go back till the beginning of this time. I started tracking time in work daily update issues starting <a href="https://github.com/liftigniter/daily-updates/issues/789" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2019</a>; I plan to backfill work time spent till as far back as then, but the backfilling is low-priority so it may take some time to complete. I had a hiatus in work daily update issues between <a href="https://github.com/liftigniter/daily-updates/issues/2524" rel="nofollow">January 29, 2020</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liftigniter/daily-updates/issues/2614" rel="nofollow">March 9, 2020</a> so I lack estimates of work time spent for that period. Starting <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/225" rel="nofollow">July 16, 2020</a>, I began regularly tracking time spent in personal daily updates.</p>
