<p>This is an online portal giving a summary of updates for <a href="https://vipulnaik.com">Vipul Naik</a>. The portal code and underlying personal data are in the <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates">daily-updates GitHub repository</a>. Work-related updates are in a private repository restricted to the workplace; therefore links to work-related updates will only work correctly for co-workers.</p>

<p>Conventions: Dates are in my local timezone, which is Pacific Time for the entire period except the period of Sunday 2024-02-18 to Friday 2024-03-15 (both ends inclusive) when I was in India (for that period I use Indian Standard Time (IST)). Until Friday 2024-02-16 and starting Saturday 2024-03-16, I use Pacific Time. Saturday 2024-02-17 is an effectively missed date due to travel.</p>

<p>However, if I stay up past midnight on a given day, the time spent is included in the "previous day"; for instance, if I stay up past midnight from 2023-12-01 to 2023-12-02, and spend 30 minutes between 1 AM and 1:30 AM on 2023-12-02 before going to sleep, I count that time under 2023-12-01. Note, however, that screen minutes per day (that I get from my computer) strictly divide days at midnight. Time spent estimates are marked "N/A" for days when I did not track time spent. Time spent estimates are generally estimates of "process time" (time spent actually actively working) rather than wall-clock time, and therefore may be lower than one might expect of wall-clock time. I do not include daily-cadence tasks and chores (such as brushing my teeth, eating, cleaning dishes after eating, daily exercise) in personal chores in daily updates issues; I also generally do not include entertainment and self-education except when I deliberately took time out for it rather than multiplexing against other chores. I skip creating a personal daily update issue on days when I do nothing that I would normally put into such an issue.</p>

<p>Important dates: I started work daily updates (for my then-job at LiftIgniter) on <a href="https://github.com/themaven-net/daily-updates/issues/2" rel="nofollow">August 10, 2018</a> and personal daily updates on <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1" rel="nofollow">October 20, 2018</a>. I started tracking time in work daily update issues starting <a href="https://github.com/themaven-net/daily-updates/issues/789" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2019</a>. I had a hiatus in work daily update issues between <a href="https://github.com/themaven-net/daily-updates/issues/2524" rel="nofollow">January 29, 2020</a> and <a href="https://github.com/themaven-net/daily-updates/issues/2614" rel="nofollow">March 9, 2020</a> so I lack estimates of work time spent for that period. Starting <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/225" rel="nofollow">July 16, 2020</a>, I began regularly tracking time spent in personal daily updates.</p>

<p>Starting <a href="https://github.com/Equator-Therapeutics/daily-updates/issues/1" rel="nofollow">February 14, 2022</a>, I began recording work I was doing for Equator. My formal start of part-time work was <a href="https://github.com/Equator-Therapeutics/daily-updates/issues/35">April 19, 2022</a>, but I did some preparatory work in the two-month period in between.</p>

<p>I left The Arena Group (the company that had acquired LiftIgniter) on <a href="https://github.com/themaven-net/daily-updates/issues/4699" rel="nofollow">Friday, September 30, 2022</a>, starting October 1, 2022, I switched to full-time work at Equator Therapeutics. After leaving The Arena Group, I lost access to my daily updates issues from my time at LiftIgniter or The Arena Group.</p>

<p>I later ended up having to leave Equator Therapeutics. My last day at Equator Therapeutics as Friday, March 3, 2023. I resumed work at The Arena Group in a part-time capacity on Monday, March 6, 2023.</p>

<p>More on the distinction between personal projects, personal chores, and other activities below.</p>

<p>"Personal projects" are generally tied to immediate or expected eventual output intended for public consumption, usually with some sort of "make the world better" goal. The key is that it should be "intended for public consumption" rather than "incidentally made public, but mainly for my own records." This could also include infrastructure work (e.g., work on server maintenance) that primarily supports such output.</p>

<p>"Personal chores" are chores I do for my own health and sustenance (excluding financial activities, that go under personal finances, income and taxes), including buying groceries, cooking, shopping, etc. It excludes regular daily activities (such as food and exercise) and also excludes very discretionary activities like eating out. Some high-level details of personal chores may be public but it is still not primarily intended for others' consumption. NOTE: Bank trips to withdraw cash are included in "personal chores" rather than personal finances.</p>

<p>"Other activities" is a broad umbrella term that covers a range of activities including chatting with friends and acquaintances on any topics where the goal is not to produce public output. Some time in other activities that is multiplexed with eating will not be included; time for picking up food from restaurants is also not included. It may also include time spent watching videos on YouTube or MasterClass that are not immediately tied to any public output I plan to produce. The same topic can shift from "other activities" to "personal projects" if I decide to produce public output related to it. For instance, if I watch or read something, it may initially go in "other activities" (and may not even be time-tracked) but if I later rewatch it with the goal of writing a public review, that rewatch time will go under personal projects.</p>
