# Succession plan

This is a succession plan for the `daily-updates`
GitHub repository and associated website https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ in
the case of Vipul Naik's death or permanent incapacitation. This plan
should be viewed as non-binding guidance on the people who will
inherit Vipul Naik's digital resources.

## Repository

### No further substantive updates

No further substantive updates should be made to this repository after
Vipul Naik's death or permanent incapacitation. That's because this
repository is intended to only cover Vipul Naik's ongoing activities,
and therefore its underlying truth should not update after his death
or permanent incapacitation.

Vipul Naik's digital successor on GitHub, or any others that person
delegates to, may make updates of this sort (but are not
obligated/expected to), and no other updates:

* Updates to indicate that Vipul Naik is deceased
* Spelling fixes
* Fixes to syntax for SQL
* Devops/maintenance fixes, such as robots.txt

### Digital successor may (optionally) archive the repository or transfer ownership

See
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-personal-accounts-repositories#about-successors)
for the full list of options available for repositories to digital
successors on GitHub.

Vipul's digital successor on GitHub may archive the repository,
assuming that the following are still true (these were true as of
2023-11-04): an archived repository can still be cloned and forked, so
no flexibility is lost. This seems like the simplest option and is
Vipul's recommended option.

Another option available to the digital successor is to transfer the
repository to the successor's own GitHub account. This may be the
right path to take if Vipul's digital successor (or somebody else whom
the successor grants write access) is interested in making the kinds
of updates listed in the preceding section.

## Website

### No need to maintain for the long term

The website https://updates.vipulnaik.com/ does not need to be kept up for
the long term, for these reasons:

* It is mainly for Vipul Naik's own reference, and was not created to
  provide lasting consumption value.

* It gets very little traffc from humans other than Vipul.

* Its content is backed up daily, and at each update, on the Wayback
  Machine. So if people are interested in the content, they can access
  it even after the site is down.

### No objections to keeping it up for the long term (but if so, it may be good to note Vipul Naik being deceased)

If the domain and hosting of the website are being maintained for the
long term, the marginal cost of keeping the website up for the long
term may be near-zero. If Vipul Naik's digital successor or others
want to keep the website up for the long term, they are welcome to do
so.

However, if the website is being kept up for the long term (for
instance, for more than five years after Vipul Naik's death) it may be
a good idea to update its homepage to note Vipul Naik's death and
thereby explain the absence of further updates.

### Probably best to let it stay up as long as the hosting and domain registration last

Vipul's thoughts are that the website can continue to stay up as long
the servers hosting it stay up, and the domain registration lasts. If
there are no other succession steps undertaken, this should be for
somewhere between a month and a year.
