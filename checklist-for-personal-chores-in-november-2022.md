# Checklist for personal chores in November 2022

I've deferred a bunch of personal chores to focus on my job transition
and then on getting on top of things at my Equator job. Unfortunately,
the process is taking longer than expected, and I don't want to keep
delaying the personal chores for too long. So I've decided to set
ambitious goals for getting through the personal chores.

Subject to change based on weather conditions and for truly
time-sensitive things, but I should try to not move this around for
purely mood-driven reasons.

## 2022-11-03 (Thursday)

- [ ] Finish heavy laundry (this is a blocker to some outside trips as I want to wash my sweatshirt post-Joinn before using it again)

## 2022-11-04 (Friday)

- [ ] I should leave by around noon so as to be back well in time for
  my 2 PM appointment: Pick up items from Amazon locker (pickup
  deadline is 2022-11-09 and I don't want to risk getting too close to
  the deadline)
- [ ] I can do this either on the return trip from the Amazon locker
  pickup (time and resources permitting) or after my Friday meetings:
  Get first pass of stuff from Walgreens

I might also do a downtown Berkeley trip after this for grocery shopping.

## 2022-11-05 (Saturday)

  but might take BART back depending on how heavy it is.
