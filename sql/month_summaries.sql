Around the middle of the month, I began to transition out of my responsibilities at Equator, and also started ramping up on developments at The Arena Group in preparation for my return. As much as possible, I continued to defer non-time-sensitive items within personal projects and personal chores, but I did need to address a few items that I had been deferring for a while. In terms of hours, this was just a little shy of a normal work month at Equator, with the gap partly accounted for by the ramp-up on The Arena Group work. The cold and rain led to me not going out for jogging on several days; however, the time saved was cancelled (or perhaps more than cancelled!) by more time spent in bed.'),

Due to a combination of these factors, as well as an accumulated backlog of personal tasks, I spent very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2023-04-01','2023-04-30','This was my second month back at The Arena Group, and my first full month and also my first month after substantively wrapping up all Equator stuff.

As a result of the focus on getting ahead on work, I spent much less time on personal projects than I hope to spend in steady state.

  ('2023-05-01','2023-05-31','This was my third month back at The Arena Group. I spent some time this month wrapping up my work on Equator and purging Equator-related stuff from my devices. I spent a little more time on my Arena Group day job (compared to my ideal steady state) due to a colleague being out of office for part of the month, and due to continued efforts catching up with things. As a result, my time on personal projects was a little less than I would ideally like in steady state. My time in other buckets was close to what I''d like in steady state.'),
  ('2023-06-01','2023-06-30','On the whole, my time distribution across buckets was similar to what I''d ideally like to have going forward.

I also spent a decent chunk of time on personal finances, income and taxes, on a combination of income tax work and many little pieces of development work on personal finances that I had queued up for a while.

I also spent a little more time than expected on other activities, most of it related to conversations; there happened to be more of these in September than in the typical month.

As for personal finances, I wrapped up a few tax-related items and by the end of the month I am back to my steady state with respect to finances. Late in the month, I introduced minimum weekly targets for personal projects and maximum weekly targets for personal chores, to make sure I''m making progress on personal projects and cap my time spent on personal chores. Along with this change, my time on personal projects started increasing in the latter half of the month, though it''s still only just around the minimum.

For day job, the first two weeks were low on day job, but the two weeks after my return were higher, so that the overall average worked out to a reasonable amount, though a little on the lower side.

My time on personal chores was also higher than what I''d like it to be in steady state, due to a bunching of various quarterly and one-off cleaning tasks, some administrative/devops setup work, my Tdap vaccine booster dose, and work on health recording and best practices that I expect to be less in the coming months. Also, recorded time on personal chores was a bit higher due to less watching of Ninja Nerd during meal prep. I spent a little bit of time on family and career planning, within my expected range, though there could be month-to-month fluctuation here depending on what I choose to tackle.

My time on personal chores was a little higher than I''d like in steady state, mostly due to health-related investigations. My time in the other activities bucket was a little higher than I expect in steady state, mostly because a bunch of one-off and infrequent meetings got bunched up into the month of August. My time on day job was at the low end, partly due to the extra time spent on personal finances, personal chores, and other activities.

  ('2024-09-01','2024-09-30','For roughly the latter half of this month, I had time-sensitive stuff to attend do with my day job, so the net result was that my time on day job this month was more than usual, and substantially than the past two months (though comparable to June). On the personal finances front, I continued to have tax-related items, but there were fewer of those than in the past two months, so my time on personal finances was less than the past two months but still higher than my steady state. My time on personal chores was higher than usual; this primarily reflects health-related activities (both dealing with health issues and longer-term research and setup work related to health). I also spent a bunch of time catching up on month change checklist items after having skipped many of them in August; I also spent time streamlining and improving the list. My time in the other activities bucket was also higher than usual, which is mostly due to consuming a lot more health-related content; much of this was multiplexed with previously-unaccounted-for time so it didn''t eat into other buckets. As a result of all these factors, my time on personal projects was lower than the last few months, though still higher than most months in the past; this reasonable average combines high values in the first half of the month and low values in the second half when time-sensitive work stuff came up.'),

With the completion of this project, I am free in future weeks to spend my personal projects time on other things. My time in the other activities bucket continued to be high, largely driven by continued medical education (Ninja Nerd, Peter Attia, and other stuff), with some contribution form periodic conversations. My time in the personal chores bucket was high compared to the past few months, driven by various periodic health-related activities (dental cleaning, flu shot, 23andMe saliva sample collection, ordering blood tests), continued health research and formulation of best practices, and annual document pouch cleanup and bureaucratic/travel planning. My expectation is that some of this will subside in the coming months, though important things still remain (blood tests, COVID vaccine, and potentially other tests and procedures). My time on personal finances was low (in contrast with the past few months), reflecting the fact that I have wrapped up all my tax work.'),
  ('2024-11-01','2024-11-30','Overall, this month was a little lower in total accounted-for time, as well as a little higher in the portion of that time that went to cyclic personal chores (cooking, grocery shopping). Both of these were largely due to winter effects: winter means more sleep and more appetite, so more eating and hence more time cooking and buying food (this is accounted) and more time on sleeping, eating, and post-meal cleanup (this is largely not accounted, unless multiplexed with other time that I count). The effect was particularly strong early in the month, when I had not adjusted fully to winter patterns. The net effect of this was that I fell below my target on personal projects, but I still managed a reasonable amount and got back above target in the last week.'),
  ('2024-12-01','2024-12-31','This month was back to being high on total accounted-for time, split across day job and other activities. The increase in day job was driven by time-sensitive stuff around the middle of the month as well as efforts in the latter half of the month to proactively clear out backlogs and streamline things in anticipation of a busy Q1 2025. The increase in the other activities bucket was driven by an increase in health learning, including more of it multiplexed with exercise and eating; part of this was driven by my taking out the Peter Attia podcast subscription for a month. While personal projects appeared to not suffer much on net compared to last month, personal projects actually flourished early in the month and had to be almost completely paused later in the month. For personal chores, although these appear close to neutral overall compared to last month (both month being affected by a generally increased cyclic personal chores load), this combines a lower load early in the month (and one that is more long-term sustainable) and a high load later in the month, due to a combination of time spent on administrative / travel / bureaucracy stuff and a greater focus on wrapping up health stuff in anticipation of having less time in Q1 2025 due to the day job.'),
  ('2025-01-01','2025-01-31','This month was somewhat busy at work as I ramped up toward a temporary increase in workload. It was also busy with personal chores that I wanted to wrap up before the increase in workload fully kicked in, including audiological evaluation, blood tests, and travel planning. In addition, it continued to be higher in cyclic personal chores driven by winter. My time in the other activities bucket continued to be high, most of it on health learning (multiplexed with eating, meal prep, and post-meal cleanup; the meal prep portion in particular means slight understatement of personal chores time) and some of it on periodic and one-off conversations. As a result of all these, I spent much less time than I''d like to on personal projects, and was also able to do only a small part of the end-of-year finances work that I''d normally do in January.'),

Overall, time spent on day job was higher than a typical month, but not as high as my target hours, mainly because I front-loaded a lot of work in January. My time on personal chores continued to be high, reflecting high cyclic personal chores load due to winter. The cyclic personal chores load started reducing in the latter half of the month, but by this time I had a large backlog of monthly tasks and other tasks (such as travel planning work) so my overall personal chores time continued to be high. My time in the other activities bucket continued to be high, primarily comprising periodic conversations and health learning, which was multiplexed with eating, meal prep, and post-meal cleanup and therefore high because those were taking more of my time. My time on personal finances was low early in the month but a couple of financial anomaly investigations late in the month caused it to be high overall. As a result of all these, my time in the personal projects bucket was very low, and all of it was on necessary tasks (such as month change checklist items), with none of it on discretionary activity.'),
  ('2025-03-01','2025-03-31','The first half of the month was officially at 75% time on day job and the second half of the month was officially at 50% time on day job; interestingly, my average time per week on day job was higher than last month (which was officially at 75% throughout) but this is partly due to the way I had distributed time between weeks during the period from mid-January to mid-March. My time on personal projects continued to be low, and whatever time I did spend was mostly on monthly tasks and other time-sensitive matters. In the last week of the month, I did a lot of work on US taxes, which averaged out to a decent amount of time per week across the whole month. My time on personal chores was a little bit less than the last few months, reflecting a mix of (a) reduced cyclic personal chores load (particularly cooking and food purchases, that are more time-intensive than laundry) as the weather got warmer, and (b) deferral of some month change checklist tasks to April in order to focus on wrapping up this iteration of work on US taxes first. My time in the other activities bucket was fairly normal, reflecting a mix of health learning and periodic conversations.');
