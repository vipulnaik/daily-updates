  ('2020-11-16',NULL),
  ('2020-11-23','I had fewer work hours than any week since I resumed hours tracking on 2020-03-09. This was mostly due to a significant amount of time on house chores and a large ammount of time on other activities not tied to my personal projects, finances, or chores.'),
  ('2020-11-30','I had fewer work hours than any week since I resumed hours tracking on 2020-03-09. The reason was two-fold: a significant amount of time wrapping up personal finances, a moderate amount of time on house chores due to a house situation, and a significant amount of time on other activities not tied to my personal projects, finances, or chores.'),
  ('2020-12-07','I had fewer accounted-for-hours than in a typical week; this was due to general end-of-year fatigue and declining work load. I also spent time on personal chores such as getting my state ID card.'),
  ('2020-12-14','I had fewer accounted-for-hours than in a typical week; this was due to a mix of increased time on house chores, that fatigued me more, and general end-of-year fatigue and declining work load. I also spent more time on personal projects than I had since July.'),
  ('2020-12-21','I had fewer day job hours than in any week since March; this was largely due to reduced workload and the additional Christmas holidays. The freed-up time went to a mix of house chores, backups, and the launch of https://ese.vipulnaik.com/ that I had been planning to do for some time. Very little went to the personal projects category.'),
  ('2020-12-28','My time on house chores went down now that a tenant was secured and started move-in. On the other hand, I spent a lot of time on end-of-year finalizations, mostly on personal finances, income and taxes. Officially, there were only three working days, and I ended up working for only a small part of the official holidays.'),
  ('2021-01-04','I had a somewhat unusual week; I spent a little more weekday time on non-work tasks, including weekly meal prep. However, I spent the weekend almost entirely on work.'),
  ('2021-01-11','This was a relatively low-energy week where I spent very little non-work time, but still had an average amount of work time spent.'),
  ('2021-01-18','I spent a lot of time this weekend on discussions and research related to health (this shows up in the other activities bucket). There was no particular urgency; I do expect to do a review of this sort every so often.'),
  ('2021-01-25','I picked up one of my personal projects that had been paused since July 2020 (work on migration policy and history). This did not eat up too much into other uses of my time, as I was overall more energetic this week and thus ended up having a more "productive" weekend.'),
  ('2021-02-01','Unlike the previous few weeks, I spent a lot of time on a house matter; this extra time came mainly at the expense of work time. Also, the end-of-month transition meant a little bit more time on personal projects and personal finances.'),
  ('2021-02-08','I spent five hours on the weekend drafting my US federal and California state income tax returns (based on preliminary calculations done back in January). This mostly ate into weekend time that I would normally spend on work.'),
  ('2021-02-15','The shadow of taxes continued: I spent a lot of time on Monday (officially a work holiday) on updating tax information in the contract work repository, and also spent time on Saturday wrapping up my tax filing. I was also able to wrap up data entry backfill for my health records. I did not spend time on the weekend cooking; as a result, I spent slightly more unduplexed time watching MasterClass and Viki.'),
  ('2021-02-22','This week had a smaller number of total accounted hours than usual, partly because of a relaxed Saturday and also because, during the week, I worked at the lower end of normal but did not use the freed-up time for any other accounted activities. Mostly, I was taking things a little bit slower.'),
  ('2021-03-01','Over the weekend, I spent a lot of time during the day lazing around, watching Encounter (Korean drama) and rewatching some episodes of Gilmore Girls. This partly explains my lower total accounted-for time over the week.'),
  ('2021-03-08','Time-sensitive tasks in the realms of house chores and other activities ended up taking way more time than usual, leading to a reduction in total time spent at work.'),
  ('2021-03-15','Time-sensitive activities involving a friend ended up taking a large share of my time this week. My total work time was therefore a little on the low end; I also ended up spending no time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-03-22','Time-sensitive activities involving a friend ended up taking a large share of my time this week. My total work time was close to normal; most of the hit was taken in my time spent on personal projects and there was also an increase in my total accounted time spent.'),
  ('2021-03-29','The main highlights outside the work front were end-of-month tasks, some house matters, and wrapping up of time-sensitive activities involving a friend.'),
  ('2021-04-05','I continued to get more on top of work, wrapping up my planned work for the week by Saturday. Sunday was a bit slow, wrapping up some important but drudge-ish work on nutrition, but I finally got around to updating my standing plan and returning to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-04-12','I spent more time than usual chatting with friends; this cut a little bit (but not too much) into work time.'),
  ('2021-04-19','I had a relatively normal amount of work time; slightly on the lower end during the week, compensated by slightly on the higher end during the weekend.'),
  ('2021-04-26','I spent a large chunk of time on two weekdays working on personal projects, explaining the greater total time spent on personal projects. My overall accounted time spent was lower than normal, partly because of less accounted time on weekends and partly because the change to increase time on personal projects led to some overhead of inefficiency.'),
  ('2021-05-03','I spent more of my weekend time working than usual.'),
  ('2021-05-10','I had somewhat-lower-than-usual total-accounted-for-hours, mostly due to some inefficiencies during the week. I didn''t spend time on personal projects or personal finances at all.'),
  ('2021-05-17','I did two rounds of cooking (and also correspondingly two rounds of food purchase) so I spent more time on personal chores than usual. The increased time came mostly at the expense of my time spent on work. I spent almost no time on personal projects and personal finances, similar to the previous week.'),
  ('2021-05-24','I spent a lot of time on disposal of items (clothes, e-waste, recycling containers) and as a result I had less time available for work and other activities. I also got my COVID shot. On Sunday, I spent a lot of time watching the TV show Startup on Netflix, resulting in lower total-accounted-for-time for the week.'),
  ('2021-05-31','I spent a lot of time on personal projects, partly because of Monday being a holiday for Memorial Day and partly because of the experimentation with reducing my work time to 75% of what it used to be. I also did two rounds of meal prep instead of one, leading to more time on personal chores than usual.'),
  ('2021-06-07','I continued to spend a lot of time on personal projects, as part of the experimentation with reducing my work time to 75% of what it used to be. I also had somewhat lower accounted-for-time than usual overall, partly as a result of overhead from the adjustment to the new routine.'),
  ('2021-06-14','This week I returned to a closer-to-normal amount of work time, correspondingly reducing my time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-06-21','I went back down to 75% work time, not fully intentionally (I was hoping to be closer to 90%). Most of the remaining time was not spent on personal projects; it was spent on a mix of personal chores (including getting and recovering from the COVID vaccine) and other activities.'),
  ('2021-06-28','I worked a little less even than my target 75% work time, mostly because I had reached a logical point with various work-related activities. I expect to do some more work in future weeks based on what fits naturally, so that the average evens out.'),
  ('2021-07-05','I worked more than my target 75% work time, partly to make up for less work than planned in previous weeks, and partly because I wanted to get ahead on time-sensitive tasks.'),
  ('2021-07-12','I worked a little bit overtime to make progress on some time-sensitive day job stuff. I had correspondingly less time for personal projects.'),
  ('2021-07-19','I worked around 100% (rather than my long-term reduced 75%) for a few reasons: (a) to make progress on time-sensitive day job stuff, (b) to cancel out early start of reduced time in June (official plan had been to start from July), and (c) to be better prepared for likely disruptions in the next few weeks.'),
  ('2021-07-26','I worked a little over my reduced (75%) time but still keeping the spirit of it by taking out a fair amount of time for personal projects. My personal projects time (not including work related to the change of month) was early in the week, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so I ended up spending time on work on Sunday.'),
  ('2021-08-02','My work hours came to my expected 75% time; however, I did not get much time for personal projects. I ended up spending a lot of time on house-related items, and also had a few meetings that fall under "other activities".'),
  ('2021-08-09','A combination of dentist trip plus followup (showing up under personal chores) and house stuff (showing up under house chores) took a large share of my time, causing my work time to fall to a little below the target 75%. In addition, partly due to fatigue and boredom, I couldn''t get to spend even my limited free time on personal projects, and I ended up instead spending it on other activities.'),
  ('2021-08-16','Like the previous week, this week was also heavy on personal chores, house chores, and other activities, but future weeks are expected to be relatively light on these fronts, allowing for a greater degree of return to personal projects. My work time was still a little below the target 75%, but I did spend some time on personal projects (albeit on Groupprops, which is not one of the two main personal projects I am focusing on).'),
  ('2021-08-23','With some house-related stuff wrapping up, I spent extra time on my day job (100%+ instead of target 75%); this helped me more than catch up on day job in terms of number of hours. I expect to return to my usual 75% on the day job in coming weeks, and use the time thus freed up to return to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-08-30','I returned more to what I expect my usual routine to be. Though I did spend more work hours than I expect to average, I also resumed work on personal projects, devoting a large portion of my Sunday to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-09-06','My total accounted time spent was much lower than usual. This is partly explained by my spending Monday on personal projects that were a little difficult to concentrate on, and consequently multiplexing with watching Netflix. I similarly multiplexed day job work on the weekend with watching Netflix. Despite the low-seeming total, I feel I had a fairly rounded week in terms of making progress on personal projects while not being too far below my target of 75% of work time for the day job.'),
  ('2021-09-13','My total accounted time spent was much lower than usual. This is partly explained by my spending Sunday on personal projects that were a little difficult to concentrate on, and consequently multiplexing with listening to podcasts and interviews. Even earlier in the week, I engaged in similar multiplexing, leading to reduced work efficiency and less accounted-for-time. See https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList for more information on my consumption.'),
  ('2021-09-20','This week was a deliberate experiment on my part with reducing work hours even more to spend more time on personal projects. I spent more time on personal projects than in any week on record since I started tracking the time a year ago. I also spent less time on work than I have in any fully recorded week. Despite these firsts, I did not develop any backlog nor did I leave any of my work colleagues blocked. The experiment was overall a success and I might do it in the future as well. The next experiment to try is taking more continuous time off work which would enable me to do pieces of personal projects that need longer stretches of time. I also spent double-time on personal chores (shopping, cooking) just as a result of timing of various things.'),
  ('2021-09-27','I spent many hours in the week dealing with personal chores (dentist trip) and house chores (toilet clog).'),
  ('2021-10-04','I spent much more time than usual on personal chores, including three rounds of meal prep and a dentist trip. I still worked a little over my 75% work hours, so personal projects took the biggest hit.'),
  ('2021-10-11','This week was partly a deliberate experiment with reducing work hours in order to spend more time on personal projects, but it also happened to be a week where I had some time-sensitive tasks in the "other activities" bucket.'),
  ('2021-10-18','This week was qualitatively similar to the previous week: I spent a lot of time on personal projects as well as in the "other activities" bucket, so my work hours fell short of the 75% target. I expect to return to a normal level of work hours by the next week or the week after. I expect that this will be via the "other activities" bucket subsiding, and I will continue to be able to spend a comparable amount of time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-10-25','My "other activities" bucket did not end up subsiding, but the previous sources of "other activities" did subside -- there was just an increase in one-off "other activities"; I also had a one-off eye exam appointment that took some time. Overall, I ended up spending a little less time on work than my target 75% time, but within the range.'),
  ('2021-11-01','As anticipated, my time in other activities started subsiding, and much of this saved time got directed to personal projects. However, my time on personal projects this week was spent more on one-off activities than on ongoing projects.'),
  ('2021-11-08','This was a relatively normal week; part of the reason for the low total-accounted-for-time was that on Sunday I went to downtown San Francisco (see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/8f6632aad2e3c24c607efc42381bd6d82987d193 for details) and only part of the trip time is accounted-for.'),
  ('2021-11-15','This was a relatively normal week; the mix of time spent across activities is close to what I target on average.'),
  ('2021-11-22','The official work week was shorter than usual on account of Thanksgiving. However, I did spend much of the Thanksgiving break doing some longer-form day job work (reading and understanding code for a ticket I intend to work on) so my total work hours were only slightly less than my typical weekly target.'),
  ('2021-11-29','This was a relatively typical week, with a couple of nuances: (a) end-of-month updates took up a large share of my personal project time, and (b) I ended up doing grocery shopping and  meal prep twice, but one of the meal prep times was largely multiplexed with work, so the effect on my personal chores time was minimal.'),
  ('2021-12-06','This was a relatively typical week, though my work hours were a little lower than usual, and time spent on "other activities" was a little higher than usual.'),
  ('2021-12-13','This week, I spent a fair amount of time on personal projects (most of the weekend and a large part of two weekdays), so my day job time spent was much lower than my typical weekly target. I also spent more time on personal chores than usual, with a dentist trip and two rounds each of grocery shopping and meal prep.'),
  ('2021-12-20','This week was unusual in a few respects: the work week was shorter due to Christmas, and I took much of Thursday and almost all of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday almost off from work other than ongoing tasks. I also got my COVID booster dose on Friday; see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2021/2021-12-24-pfizer-covid-vaccine-booster-dose.md for more details.'),
  ('2021-12-27','This was an unusual week, with just three official working days, due to Christmas and New Year''s. Most of my work was only on the official working days. In addition to personal projects, I spent a lot of time on other activities, including chatting with friends and consuming a MasterClass Session. I also spent a fair amount of time on end-of-year finances work.'),
  ('2022-01-03','This was a fairly typical week albeit with more time on other activities instead of personal projects. Although Monday was a holiday from work, I still did the equivalent of a full week of work by working a little extra on the weekend.'),
  ('2022-01-10','This was a week with a lot of time spent on other activities (meetings with friends); this did cut a little bit into my work hours but the overall effect was to increase my accounted time spent.'),
  ('2022-01-17','This was a typical week work-wise; however, I spent a lot more time on other activities and a lot less time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-01-24','This was a much-busier-than-usual week work-wise, with the amount of time on work comparable to what I used to spend in Q1/Q2 2021, before reducing work time. I also spent a fair amount of time in the other activities bucket, and very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-01-31','This was a fairly busy week work-wise, comparable to Q1/Q2 2021, before reducing work time, and similar to the previous week. I also spent a lot of time arranging my travel history and getting various documents together, most of which went under "personal chores"; my time on "other activities" was less than the last few weeks but higher than my historical steady state; I expect it to be representative of my steady state for the next few months.'),
  ('2022-02-07','This was a typical week work-wise. I spent way more time than usual on personal finances, mainly working on my 2021 taxes. I also spent a lot of time on house chores, way more than I had anticipated spending. My "other activities" was similar to last week, so "personal projects" was the main area that suffered.'),
  ('2022-02-14','This was a typical week work-wise. Like the previous week, I spent way more time than usual on personal finances, mainly working on my 2021 taxes, but I succeeded in wrapping it up so future weeks should be relatively free of personal finances work. I began formally recording my time spent related to Equator, that I was planning to join part-time in a couple of months. Of the buckets, "personal projects" was the main one that suffered.'),
  ('2022-02-21','This week was somewhat on the lower end work-wise, but still within range, and somewhat higher than usual on the preparatory work for Equator, but still within range. As with previous weeks, "personal projects" continued to suffer.'),
  ('2022-02-28','This week was very low on day job, for several reasons. The Equator WeWork get together contributed to the high amount of time on Equator preparatory work. "House chores" was a little higher than usual as I was cleaning stuff out after the departure of two housemates. A power cut on Friday disrupted my schedule somewhat. Finally, unlike previous weeks, I did take out some time for personal projects. Combined, all these factors led to a lower amount of time on the day job.'),
  ('2022-03-07','My time on day job was pretty normal. My time on "other activities" was higher than usual even compared to recent weeks, partly due to a lunch with work colleagues and partly because I spent time reading and thinking about things.'),
  ('2022-03-14','This was a relatively normal week compared to the standard set by previous weeks. In particular, time on day job was normal, and time on Equator preparatory work was comparable to the last couple of months.'),
  ('2022-03-21','The weekday portion of the week was fairly normal, but the weekend was unusual with a large amount of time spent on personal finances and on house chores (apartment search).'),
  ('2022-03-28','The weekday portion of the week was fairly normal (other than time early in the week on apartment search), but the weekend was unusual with a large amount of time spent on personal projects (biology reading and work on the cellbio subwiki).'),
  ('2022-04-04','This was an unusual week, with a huge proportion of time spent on personal chores (dealing with cracked phone screen, getting new phone and laptop) and house chores (working out my house move). I spent less time than usual on day job, personal projects, and other activities.'),
  ('2022-04-11','This week, I spent a lot of time in work related to my house move. This cut into my time on work (both my LiftIgniter / Arena Group work and my preparatory work for Equator), personal projects, and other activities.'),
  ('2022-04-18','This was the week that I moved house, so I spent a lot of time on the move and on related disposal and cleanup work. It was also the week that I started part-time at Equator (on 2022-04-19) so starting this week, my time on LiftIgniter / Arena Group work fell and my time on Equator rose.'),
  ('2022-04-25','I continued to spend a fair amount of time on cleanup and disposal related to the house I had moved out of; this ate into my time in the various other buckets.'),
  ('2022-05-02','I spent even more time than in the past two weeks on cleanup and disposal related to the house I had moved out of; this ate into my time in the various other buckets. I finished up most of the work needed so I expect the coming week and future weeks to be closer to normal.'),
  ('2022-05-09','This was a typical week, hitting the desired distribution of time spent that I hope to maintain for the next few months.'),
  ('2022-05-16','This was a somewhat atypical week, with slightly less time on Equator than I would ideally like to spend, but more time on personal projects, most of it spent on server devops streamlining.'),
  ('2022-05-23','This week was mostly spent on Equator stuff, roughly at the level that I''d like to maintain for the next few months. I spent more time than expected on personal chores as I was dealing with stains and then eye and skin irritation; I spent very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-05-30','This week was mostly spent on Equator stuff, roughly at the level that I''d like to maintain for the next few months. I also spent more time on personal projects than in the previous week (something I consider desirable).'),
  ('2022-06-06','This week was somewhat busier with The Arena Group work than the past few weeks; my Equator work suffered a little bit but not much, and the overall effect was an increase in my total accounted hours.'),
  ('2022-06-13','This was a reasonably typical week, with a few differences: I spent more time on personal chores than usual, with the extra time going into a dentist trip as well as work on scripts to check for uncommitted and unsynced changes on my laptop. I also spent more time on personal projects, including coordinating with a new funding source from the Future Fund and continued work on devops streamlining. These resulted in a little bit less time than usual for my Equator work.'),
  ('2022-06-20','This was a somewhat unusual week with much more time on personal chores than usual; most of this time was for outside trips that were one-off and were upfront investments in a better long-term setup. My work on Equator and on personal projects suffered most directly. I also spent a bit more time on personal finances, partly related to the imminent end of Q2 2022.'),
  ('2022-06-27','This week was somewhat unusual in two respects: (1) a bunch of Q3 2022 planning for LiftIgniter / The Arena Group stuff led to me spending way more time than usual on The Arena Group, (2) I spent a fair amount of time on the weekend on personal projects, mainly updating the contract work portal to better showcase other payers. Combined, these led to way less time on Equator than I had spent in previous weeks and hope to spend in coming weeks.'),
  ('2022-07-04','I spent a substantial amount of time this week on personal projects, mostly devops streamlining work and some related work. Equator work suffered a little bit as a result. I also spent a little more time on personal chores than usual; much of the extra time was driven by personal practices documentation work.'),
  ('2022-07-11','I spent some time this week on personal projects, mostly devops streamlining work wrapping up threads started over the weekend. I also spent a little more time on Arena Group work than I would like to in steady state, as well as more time on personal chores driven by personal practices documentation work. Equator work suffered due to a combination of all these.'),
  ('2022-07-18','This week, I spent an unusually large amount of time on personal projects: this was a mix of somewhat-time-sensitive work on devops streamlining, as well as not-so-time-sensitive work on the donations list website. My Equator time suffered as a result. My time on LiftIgniter / Arena was in the desired range (not too high, but high enough to deal with ongoing things).'),
  ('2022-07-25','This week, I spent an unusually large amount of time on Arena Group stuff, mostly related to transferring some responsibilities and streamlining some tasks; I expect the next few weeks to be much lower on Arena Group work. My Equator work suffered a bit as a result; I partly caught up on Equator work on Sunday but it wasn''t enough. I also ended up spending much less time than usual on personal projects and also less time than usual on personal chores (skipping one round of meal prep) to make way for the increased workload.'),
  ('2022-08-01','This week, I spent more time on personal chores than usual, mainly due to once-in-two-months Walgreens shopping, once-in-two-months Amazon package pickup, and the need for two Trader Joe''s trips because some stuff wasn''t available during my first trip. It was otherwise a fairly typical week. Since I had placed Arena Group transition/streamlining work on hold, I spent relatively little time on it, and was able to devote most of my work time to Equator.'),
  ('2022-08-08','This week, in addition to spending a lot of time on Equator (as I had hoped) I also ended up spending a lot of time on Arena Group work -- this was because I decided to get a head start on some things I had hoped to wrap up in coming weeks. I was able to keep my time spent in other buckets to a relatively low level to make room for the increased total time across day jobs, and I also ended up clocking more tracked time in total than in the past few weeks.'),
  ('2022-08-15','This week, I spent a large amount of time on Arena Group work, mostly related to transferring some responsibilities and streamlining some tasks; I expect to spend comparable (though slightly less) time on Arena Group for the next two weeks after which my time on Arena Group should drop significantly. This resulted in less time on Equator and personal projects than I''d like to spend on an ongoing basis. Time in other buckets was close to expectations.'),
  ('2022-08-22','This week, I spent a large amount of time on Arena Group work, mostly related to transferring some responsibilities and streamlining some tasks; the amount spent was slightly less than the previous week, as anticipated. I expect to spend an even smaller amount of time on Arena Group work in the coming week. The greater time on Arena Group work meant less time for Equator work; I did end up spending a fair amount of time on personal projects. Time in other buckets was close to expectations.'),
  ('2022-08-29','This week, I spent a large amount of time on Arena Group work, mostly related to transferring some responsibilities and streamlining some tasks; the amount spent was slightly more than the previous week. The coming week I am going to spend minimal time on Arena Group work, and in the remaining three weeks of September, my Arena Group transition work will be moderate. I spent a lot of time on personal projects, partly due to end-of-month transition, and partly because I used the weekend to make significant progress with personal projects. I also spent time on various "other activities" including catching up with a friend and reading some stuff I used to be interested in. My Equator work suffered due to a combination of these factors, but I expect to spend much more time on Equator work in the coming weeks.'),
  ('2022-09-05','This week was a holiday from Arena Group work, explaining the very low amount of time I ended up spending on Arena Group work. I ended up using a lot of the freed-up time on personal projects, so my Equator work didn''t go up as much as I would have hoped for. The heat early in the week also took its toll in terms of the kinds of work I was able to do.'),
  ('2022-09-12','This was the last week with significant transition work for The Arena Group. Only a few small pieces remain for the weeks of 2022-09-19 and 2022-09-26; after 2022-09-30 there should be no work for The Arena Group. The spike in wrap-up efforts related to The Arena Group account for the reduced amount of work on Equator. Time on personal projects was mostly time spent discussing timelines (and making plans for their future) on Saturday.'),
  ('2022-09-19','This week, I continued doing some transition work and a lot of cleanup work related to The Arena Group; there turned out to be a bunch of resources to examine as I cleaned up. My personal chores time was higher for two reasons. (1) My impending departure from The Arena Group meant that I would no longer have access to events of biographical significance, so I spent a bunch of time adding summaries by month and year covering my tenure at LiftIgniter (and a few months prior). (2) I spent a bunch of time consolidating stuff related to account recovery, emergency contacts, etc. My personal projects time was mostly on devops streamlining and dealing with intermittent server overload issues; some of this was motivated by a recent increase in the frequency of such issues and some of it was driven by my imminent server migration plan. As a result of all these, I spent much less time on Equator work than I had hoped for, and will likely need to work extra hard in the coming weeks to catch up with the backlog.'),
  ('2022-09-26','This was my last week working for The Arena Group. I spent a lot of time this work on transition and cleanup related to The Arena Group. I also spent a bunch of personal chores time on various personal password and security updates, much of which dovetailed well with the transition and cleanup at work. I also spent some personal projects time early in the week on devops streamlining. As a result of all these, I spent much less time on Equator work and on other personal projects than I would have liked to. I expect to spend significantly more time on Equator starting next week as I will be spending ~0 time on The Arena Group.'),
  ('2022-10-03','This was my first week after officially transitioning to full-time work at Equator. I took things a bit slowly this week, as I was fairly fatigued from the significant transition work of the preceding weeks. This explains the lower total accounted-for-time this week. My Equator time was higher than it had been in recent weeks but not its highest overall (just the third highest) reflecting some of this taking-it-easy. I spent about 2 hours on some residual Arena transition work, and also spent time on end-of-month updates, time-sensitive portions of devops streamlining, and some shopping that I had deferred due to the hectic transition work of the past few weeks.'),

Some of it was on devops streamlining, about half of that being fairly time-sensitive. The rest was on a blog post that I wanted to get out describing my thinking on donations; in exchange, I decided to defer further work on the donations list website this quarter. I also started spending time this week on family planning. The net effect of all this was that I spent less time on my day job than I''d hoped. I expect the next week to be fairly different and much more focused on day job, as I have fewer personal meetings and I''m done with the most time-sensitive devops streamlining work.'),
  ('2022-10-17','This week I was focused on Equator work, and I was successful at spending more time than I had anticipated being able to spend. My time in other categories was in the ballpark of what I''d like it to be.'),
  ('2022-10-24','This week was close to my desired mix; I spent a little less time on Equator than I''d like to in an average week; this was partly due to a little more time (than my weekly target) on personal projects (blog post + devops streamlining) and a little more time on personal chores (two round of meal prep + end-of-month tasks).'),
  ('2022-10-31','This week was close to my desired mix; I spent a little less time on Equator than I''d like to in an average week; this was partly due to a little more time (than my weekly target) on personal chores, primarily related to end-of-month stuff. My total accounted-for hours were also lower than usual, largely because of the nature of the work I was doing this week.'),
  ('2022-11-07','This week was somewhat unusual for several reasons. Primarily, I spent a bunch of time on personal chores, including getting a COVID-19 vaccine as well as shopping trips. The side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccine reduced my productivity the next day (this was within the range of expectation; see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2022/2022-11-09-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md for more). Also, I spent a bunch of time (that I had not anticipated) catching up with the demise of FTX; some of this time was recorded under personal projects, but much of it was untracked. Overall, I spent a little less time on Equator than I would ideally like to spend.'),
  ('2022-11-14','This was an extremely unusual week as I ended up spending very little time on my day job (Equator). There were a number of reasons: (1) I had reached a logical point with respect to some of my Equator work, meaning that I could take a break without disrupting my flow. (2) I spent a bunch of time on devops streamlining as well as writing blog posts documenting it, as well as a blog post inspired by some personal practices around data leakage (which is outside of but still related to my devops streamlining work). (3) I ended up spending a fair amount of time on personal projects and other activities for things related to the recent FTX collapse. (4) I happened to have two lengthy conversations with friends and some followup text communication (the cadence is about monthly; it just so happens that both fell within this week); this contributed to both my "other activities" and my "Arena Group" work buckets. (5) I was also working on selling my Arena Group shares and doing some related financial stuff, which took a small but non-negligible portion of my time.'),
  ('2022-11-21','This week was more normal than the previous week, though still a little unusual due to the large amount of time spent on personal projects (a mix of my devops streamlining project and timelines work), personal finances (mostly related to selling stock from Arena and related paperwork), and personal chores (a bunch of password updates and getting my flu shot). As a result, my day job time was a little less than typical, but the margin of difference wasn''t huge -- comparable to missing one day of work. In particular, the drop was less than what it would have been if I had taken Thanksgiving off of work.'),
  ('2022-11-28','Overall, this was a slow week, with a relatively smaller number of total tracked hours. The main reason for this is that I was focused on various things related to my day job that had a relatively low ratio of tracked time to total time. As I was more focused on my day job, my total time spent in other areas was relatively low. Most of my personal projects time was related to devops streamlining, figuring out the Future Fund timelines situation, and stuff related to the change of month.'),
  ('2022-12-05','Overall, this was a very heavy week on the day job side, and a light week in most other respects. Part of the reason was that it so happened that I had made a bunch of shopping trips the previous week and I ended up not having to do any shopping this week. My cooking time was also partly multiplexed with other things, reducing the time on personal chores further. In addition, I was on a roll with respect to day job work, and ended up spending a lot of time on it. I also did not spend any time on personal projects other than some routine upgrades.'),
  ('2022-12-12','This week was a bit below average at work, but much of this was a scheduling effect, whereby various non-work items accumulated this week. Some of these were things pushed off from last week (that was very focused on work) whereas others were things that had been slated for this week (such as a monthly meeting with former work colleagues as well as figuring out the Future Fund Regranting Program situation). With these caveats, this was a fairly normal week.'),
  ('2022-12-19','This week was fairly normal at work, though a bit lower than normal if the time on the social dinner is subtracted. My personal projects time included a bunch of one-off items including a ChatGPT post and coordination around Future Fund Regranting Program timelines, so I didn''t make progress with my main personal projects. Personal chores time was a little higher than usual, mainly because of a dental cleaning trip.'),
  ('2022-12-26','This week was fairly normal at work. It was high on personal finances (due to time spent on preliminary 2022 tax calculations) and also high on other activities (driven mainly by a trip to San Francisco to have lunch with former work colleagues). I did only one round of cooking, so my time on personal chores ended up being lower than usual. I also spent very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2023-01-02','This week was fairly normal at work. I spent a little more time on personal finances than is typical (the extra time was mostly related to month-end and year-end work), and less time on personal projects than I would like. Most of my personal projects time was related to month-end work.'),
  ('2023-01-09','This week I spent more time at work than usual, but understandably so due to some time-sensitive tasks I needed to work on. Correspondingly, my time on personal projects was lower than what I want to target on average. Time in other categories was fairly normal.'),
  ('2023-01-16','This week I spent a little less time at work than usual; I worked pretty hard during the week, but then used the weekend for a mix of personal projects and personal chores catch-up and some end-of-month tasks done in advance. Otherwise, the week was fairly normal.'),
  ('2023-01-23','This week was fairly normal at work (in terms of work hours). I spent more time than usual in the "other activities" bucket, most of which was related to in-person and virtual meetings with people, most of which are less frequent than weekly. I spent very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2023-01-30','This week was fairly normal at work (in terms of work hours). My total accounted-for-time was less than most weeks; this is likely a result of me getting a bit fatigued of work but continuing to try to hit my target number of work hours, resulting a lower total number of accounted-for hours.'),
  ('2023-02-06','This week was a little lower than normal at work but still within range. The slight reduction was because I spent a little more time on personal projects, personal finances, and personal chores compared to previous weeks, mostly catching up on month-end work and a daily updates backlog. My total accounted-for hours were still lower than my historical average, but had recovered a bit relative to the previous week due to the greater diversity in the range of tasks I was doing.'),
  ('2023-02-13','This was the first week where I put in a nontrivial amount of time toward ramping up at Arena Group in preparation for my return there on 2023-03-06. My time at Equator was a little less than usual, partly for that reason, but still within range.'),
  ('2023-02-20','This week, I continued to ramp up on work for The Arena Group, in preparation for my return there on 2023-03-06. It also so happened that two rounds of grocery store trip + meal prep happened this week (the average is about once every 4-5 days, so this was a high but not unusually high week). I also spent more time than expected messaging friends. Combined, these factors led to me spending less time on Equator than I had hoped for. However, this was also a week where I discontinued most of my ongoing tasks for Equator, so the decline in hours did not affect ongoing deliverables (it only slowed down my efforts to wrap up loose ends).'),

First, I spent a bunch of time related to my job transition, some of which shows up under Equator time, some of which shows up under Arena time, and some of which shows up under personal chores. Second, I got through some of the backlog of personal chores that had accumulated in previous weeks as a result of my focus on wrapping things up at Equator. Third, I also dealt with some change-of-month items. Fourth, partly for relaxation and rejuvenation, I spent some time on Sunday on a blog post related to my devops streamlining. The net effect was less time than usual spent on Equator, and a little more time than usual on personal projects and personal chores. I plan to spend some time wrapping up Equator stuff over the next two weeks, and I expect to make up for the slight reduction in Equator time in this week.'),
  ('2023-03-06','This was my first week back at The Arena Group, and I still had a bunch of work to wrap up from Equator. I worked the equivalent of a full-time week for The Arena Group, though a large portion of it was setup, so the work toward actual deliverables was closer to my intended half-time. I spent a bunch of time on Equator during the weekend. The rejuvenating change of pace and the relatively straightforward but still non-repetitive nature of a bunch of the pieces of work meant that I clocked more recorded hours than I had been in most of the preceding weeks.'),

As a result, my time spent in personal buckets was relatively low.'),
  ('2023-03-27','This was the last week where I had substantive work to do as part of my planned Equator wrap-up, though a little bit of verification and feedback incorporation still remains as of the end of the week. I continued to spend more time on Arena work than my planned 50%, in order to get ahead of various things. I also used this week to go through my taxes and request an extension, and also caught up with a bunch of change-of-month tasks. For these many reasons, my time on personal projects continued to be low.'),
  ('2023-04-03','In this week, I worked 100% (and a bit more) on Arena stuff. This was largely a deliberate decision: I wanted to wrap up a few time-sensitive things at work before switching gears to 50% time. However, I did end up spending some extra time at work even compared to my plan; much of this was due to an unexpected and highly time-sensitive issue at work. My time on personal chores was quite typical; my time on personal projects suffered.'),

This was a deliberate decision: I wanted to wrap up a few time-sensitive things at work before switching gears to 50% time.

  ('2023-04-17','This was my last planned week of 100% work on Arena stuff. While the week mostly proceeded as expected, some time-sensitive investigations ended up using a bunch more of my weekend time than I had anticipated. As a result, I didn''t spend as much time catching up on my other backlog as I had previously hoped I would. The investigation did not wrap up within the week so it would leak into the next week as well.'),
  ('2023-04-24','This was my first week planned at 50% work, with Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday designated as my work days. However, due to a time-sensitive task, I ended up working very long hours on Monday and also ended up working a large share of Wednesday catching up on threads that I had to postpone. Overall, this turned out to be a well-over-100% week in practice, but I still managed to keep Wednesday and Friday free of commitments, and started setting the stage for future weeks where I expect and hope to take these days off more fully. I also had more accounted-for-hours than in a typical week; my extra work hours were concentrated on Monday so I still had the weekend free. So I was able to make progress on some of my backlog items over the weekend.'),

I also did the last leg of my work for Equator on Sunday; in order to finish this, I deferred cooking. As a result, my total time on personal chores this week was extremely low, as it did not include any cooking session.

This shows up as much more time on personal chores than usual, and less time on day job and personal projects.

My day job time was a couple hours less than my weekly target (largely due to my not being fully recovered), but still reasonably within range.

The reason for the day job being at the high end was a bunch of time I spent on a year-end-retrospective; excluding this time, my day job time was a little above the weekly minimum. I also spent a bunch of time on some relatively one-off setup work around family and career planning, mostly centered on thinking about and preparing for the medium-term future rather than addressing any time-sensitive needs. For personal chores, I spent a little more than my hoped-for steady-state average, mostly due to am Amazon package pickup trip. For other activities, I met up with a friend and caught up with another friend over a call, which explains it being slightly more than usual, though not by a huge amount. The combination of these factors led to me not spending too much time on personal projects; I basically hit my weekly minimum early in the week and then stopped in order to focus on the other buckets.'),
  ('2023-12-11','This was a somewhat unusual week. I went a little over my weekly maximum target for my day job; the reason for going over was that I wanted to get a few things wrapped up before an upcoming code freeze at work. I also spent a lot more time this week in the "other activities" bucket; this was due to a mix of a lot of time commenting on an EA Forum post https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims and various scheduled and impromptu meetings with other people. I also continued to spend time on family and career planning, though not as much as last week. My time on personal chores was a little higher than my steady-state value, largely due to a few middle-of-month tasks. As a result of all these, I ended up spending very little time on personal projects, well below my minimum target.'),
  ('2023-12-18','This week was close to normal, with the main difference from a normal week being that I spent less time on personal projects than my weekly target, largely because I spent time on the high end (though still within limits) on both my day job and personal chores. Both of those were for things that were not super-time-sensitive but that I wanted to get done sooner than later for strategic reasons (on the day job side, I wanted to get some stuff done before code freeze on the off-chance that it could result in a release; on the personal chores front, I wanted to do some stuff with clothes revamp and trip packing to be better prepared for my upcoming India trip.'),
  ('2023-12-25','This week was a little unusual. I did not spend much time on my day job, mainly due to a day job holiday, but my three-week average still worked out to being within range. I spent a lot of time both in the personal finances, income and taxes bucket (mostly related to year-end finances and taxes work; this was above my one-week and three-week-average targets but still within my five-week-average target) and in the personal chores bucket (mostly related to trip planning; this was above my one-week target but within my three-week-average target). My time in the personal projects bucket was below my one-week, three-week, and five-week targets, though it wasn''t too low.'),

I spent a decent amount of time both in the personal finances, income and taxes bucket and the personal chores bucket, for a mix of monthly tasks, year-end tasks, and tasks related to my upcoming travel. My time in the other activities bucket and family and career planning bucket were within range. My time in the personal projects bucket was below my target, though hopefully with the monthly, year-end, and travel-related stuff wrapping up, my time on personal projects will soon go back to being within range.'),

My time in the other activities bucket was also fairly high, mostly due to periodic and one-off meetings. My time in the personal chores bucket was a little higher than usual, mostly due to the COVID-19 booster dose and also to a lesser extent due to monthly tasks and travel-related preparation. As a result of all these, my time on personal projects was very little.'),
  ('2024-01-15','This week was fairly unusual. I spent a lot of time on personal chores, with most of the additional time spent on stuff related to preparation for my upcoming trip. My time in the other activities bucket was high as I was watching a lot of Ninja Nerd videos learning medical stuff; since a lot of this watch time was while eating, it added to my total accounted-for time. In addition, some of the time was during meal prep, which caused my reported time on personal chores to be less than what I actually spent, though my overall time on personal chore ended up fairly high despite this! My day job time was a little less than my weekly target but comfortably within my three-week-average target. I spent a little bit of time on personal finances, mostly related to India-side income for US taxes. As a result of all these, my time on personal projects this week was fairly low.'),

I spent a bunch of time on my taxes (going into the personal finances, income and taxes bucket) as well as a bunch of time related to trip prep (adding to my usual personal chores in my personal chores bucket). I also continued watching Ninja Nerd videos; these were the dominant contributor to the other activities bucket. My time on day job was also high, a little higher than my weekly target but within my three-week-average target. As a result of all these, I spent very little recorded time on personal projects and no recorded time on family and career planning.'),

I spent a bunch of time on my taxes (going into the personal finances, income and taxes bucket) as well as some time related to trip prep (adding to my usual personal chores in my personal chores bucket). Unlike last week, the focus was more on taxes and less on trip prep, so my total time on personal chores was only slightly higher than steady state. I also continued watching Ninja Nerd videos, albeit at a slower rate than the past two weeks. My time on day job was also high, just a little under my weekly target. As a result of all these, I spent very little recorded time on personal projects and no recorded time on family and career planning.'),
  ('2024-02-05','This week continued to be somewhat unusual: I spent a bunch of time on personal chores, with most of the additional time related to monthly tasks and trip prep. I also continued watching Ninja Nerd videos; this accounts for the bulk of my time in the other activities bucket. My day job time was around the middle of my range. Towards the end of the week, I slowed down overall, largely a reaction to exerting myself more than usual over the past few weeks, and also in an effort to reset my sleep cycle toward sleeping earlier (which meant a few shorter days as I made the adjustment) so my total accounted time was a little lower than usual. As a result of all this, my time on personal projects was lower than usual, and most of that time was on monthly tasks.'),

I did not count most of the time in the flight as accountd time. 2024-02-16 was my date of flying out; 2024-02-18 was my date of arrival; 2024-02-17 was a day lost in transit (due to timezone change). Due to the huge amount of time spent traveling and on related preparation and adjustment, my hours in buckets outside personal projects had low amounts of time spent. For day job, my high amounts of time spent in the past few weeks kept my three-week average within target, despite a low total in the week. The amount for personal projects was very low, reflecting that I am continuing to postpone personal projects work. Also, due to timezone changes by the time I got around to recording, I failed to record the screen time per day for most days of this week.'),
  ('2024-02-19','This was my first full week in India. A lot of the early part of the week was spent on bureaucratic stuff, and there was some more later in the week, explaining my high amount of time in the personal chores bucket. Some tours of the area with my parents account for most of the other activities bucket. My time on day job was low because of (already marked) time off to allow me to adjust and finish my bureaucratic work; I was above the bare minimum weekly and still within my five-week average. My time on personal projects, though below my weekly target, was higher than the past few weeks as I started picking up more personal projects stuff after several weeks, now that I''m done with the trip prep and initial bureaucracy associated with the trip.'),
  ('2024-02-26','A bunch of unexpected bureaucratic stuff got lumped up into this week, resulting in a huge amount of time in the personal chores bucket. My day job bucket suffered, as I had to take the period of Wednesday to Friday off to focus on the bureaucratic stuff. My time on personal projects was also fairly low, with most of that limited time spent early in the week before the bureaucratic stuff emerged.'),
  ('2024-03-04','Bureaucratic stuff took up my time on Monday and Tuesday, but was minimal after that. As a result, my time in the personal chores bucket was a little higher but not a lot higher than usual. My time on day job was fairly normal. I spent time in the other activities bucket on some things related to my bureaucratic trip as well as some other things I wanted to do while in India. My tie on personal projects, though low early in the week, was high on Sunday as I had wrapped up for the week for day job and personal chores, so I felt free to spend the day on personal projects.'),

The week was heavy on personal chores, mostly stuff related to prep for travel and post-travel adjustment, even though I didn''t count time in the flight itself. I failed to record screen time for Friday 2024-03-15 (and it''s hard to reconstruct due to the timezone change). I also spent a bit more time than usual in the other activities bucket; a lot of this time was one-off stuff with my parents that benefited from being physically present with them. Due to the huge amount of time on personal chores and the moderately high amount on other activities, my time on day job and personal projects suffered quite a bit.'),
  ('2024-03-18','This week was higher than usual on both my day job and my personal chores. The greater-than-usual time on personal chores was largely due to additional chores related to my return from India. The greater-than-usual time on day job was for a mix of reasons: first, I wanted to make up for the extremely low hours the previous week; second, there was some time-sensitive work that came up later in the week. My time in the other activities bucket was high, mostly due to a few scheduled meetings catching up with people. As a result of all these, my time on personal projects was fairly low, and I wasn''t able to make progress on any of the priorities that my weekly issue https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1508 lists.'),
  ('2024-03-25','This week was higher than usual on day job, personal chores, and other activities. The greater-than-usual time on personal chores was largely due to additional chores related to my return from India, continuing from last week; by the end of this week, I''m almost wrapped up with the additional items from my India trip but there are still a few items I need to tackle over the next one or two weeks. The time on day job, though a little higher than usual, was comfortably within range; it reflected continued efforts to get on top of things after my India trip as well as a few time-sensitive tasks. I now feel largely caught up, so that my time in coming weeks on day job may be a little lower. The huge amount of time in the other activities bucket was primarily driven by an in-person meeting with work colleagues that happened this week. The impetus for the meeting was a colleague visiting from out of town. As a result of all these, my time on personal projects was fairly low, and I wasn''t able to make progress on any of the priorities that my weekly issue https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1515 lists.'),
  ('2024-04-01','This week was a little closer to my desired ideal split than the previous weeks had been, though it still wasn''t completely normal. My time on day job was within range and a little below the middle of the range, which is ideal. My time on personal chores was still a little higher than what I''d ideally like going forward, though comfortably within range, and lower than the last two weeks. My time on personal projects was lower than my desired minimum going forward, but still significantly higher than the past few weeks, and I was able to make some progress with my personal projects priorities that https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1523 lists. The seemingly high time on other activities was partly driven by time watching videos while multiplexed with food prep, which means that my time on personal chores is effectively underestimated a little bit.'),
  ('2024-04-08','Similar to the previous week, this week was close to but not quite at my desired ideal split. My time on day job was one minute short of the weekly target, but comfortably above what was needed for the three-week average. My time on personal projects was very similar to the previous week and still below the target of 5 hours per week; this was mainly because of some time spent this weekend handling monthly personal chores items (some of which I wanted to wrap up because of next weekend being busy). However, if it hadn''t been for those monthly personal chores I needed to wrap up, I would have been able to get above the 5 hours. The high time on other activities is mainly due to a three-hour conversation with work colleagues on Wednesday; most of the rest of the time was spent watching Ninja Nerd videos. My personal chores time was a bit higher than my ideal, but well within range; the main reason it was a little higher was monthly tasks as well as a few remaining one-off tasks from after my trip. With that said, it would have been even higher if I hadn''t multiplexed some of that time with day job and watching Ninja Nerd videos. Overall, I am cautiously optimistic about making solid progress with personal projects by continuing with the same approach I followed this week, though the coming week in particular may not go too well due to stuff over the weekend.'),
  ('2024-04-15','On Sunday, I went to attend an event, that ended up taking up a bunch of my time (this explains the high amount of time in the other activities bucket). Despite this, I was almost able to meet my weekly targets in the personal projects bucket, while also significantly exceeding my minimum weekly target for my day job. My time in the personal chores bucket was fairly typical and close to my expected steady state, though a little underestimated due to multiplexing some of that time with watching videos.'),
  ('2024-04-22','This week was a little unusual due to some additional time spent on house stuff (that fortunately got wrapped up) as well as abdominal pain (see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2024/2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md for details) that caused my total accounted-for time to be lower than usual, as well as used up some of that accounted-for time for health documentation and actions. Despite these complications, I was able to hit my target number of hours for day job as well as personal projects, with this being the first week in a while where I hit my target hours for personal projects. My time in the other activities bucket was split between continuing to watch videos and chatting with a friend and parents.'),
  ('2024-04-29','This week was fairly unusual due to a bunch of time spent investigating and documenting the situation with my abdominal pain, that had a bit of a resurgence after peaking last week. In particular, this included a lengthy visit to urgent care https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2024/2024-04-30-urgent-care-visit-and-tests.md and review of the test results. This explains the much higher-than-usual amount of time in the personal chores bucket. As a result of this, my time on personal projects was a little lower than my desired time of 5 hours, but still reasonably respectable given the circumstances. My time on day job was less than my weekly target but still within my 3-week target and also within my weekly target with the use of 2 hours on devops stuff. Most of my time in the other activities bucket was spent watching videos.'),
  ('2024-05-06','This week, I spent a little more time than usual on personal chores, mostly due to an Amazon package pickup, additional rounds of meal prep (both Monday and Sunday) thanks to scheduling, as well as additional food prep due to the temporary switch away from wheat toward rice and lentils. Some of this also shows up as increased time in the other activities bucket, due to the multiplexing of food prep with watching videos. My time on day job was within range, about an hour above my weekly minimum target. My time on personal projects was below my target minimum of 5 hours; this is mostly because I didn''t really start working on personal projects until the weekend, though I did end up spending a fair amount of time on them on the weekend. Unlike recent weeks, I didn''t spend any of the time on devops stuff, instead spending my time on Wikipedia page creation; this change made sense because unlike previous weeks, I spent more time this week on the day job, and devops stuff has more cognitive overlap with the day job, so switching to Wikipedia page creation allowed me more variety. My time on other activities was high partly due to a monthly meeting with work colleagues, partly due to spending some time on medical knowledge testing, and partly due to multiplexing with more meal prep time.'),
  ('2024-05-13','This week was a little higher on personal chores than usual. In addition to increased cooking load due to dietary changes after my digestive issues, the main reason for this was setup work around monthly blood pressure readings and stethoscope use, plus some long-overdue vacuuming and bathtub scrubbing; while the tasks themselves are recurring tasks, the research that I needed to do is more one-time, and for some of the tasks, doing them regularly will reduce the amount of effort per iteration due to more practice and less buildup. My time on personal projects was above both my old target (5 hours) and new target (4 hours) and I was satisfied with my progress on personal projects this week. Due to the combination of these, as well as the lack of any time-sensitive tasks at work, my time on day job was a little lower than usual, though still within the new three-week average minimum target (and only two minutes less than the new weekly minimum target). For the other activities bucket, most of my time here was on the usual stuff (watching videos, chatting with parents).'),
  ('2024-05-20','This week was higher than usual (though still within range) for both day job and personal chores. The increases in both cases were driven by research and preparation for a potential upcoming work trip. I counted towards work time the portion of the research that was specific to the trip and its destination, and towards personal time the more general travel research that I need to do due to not being a frequent traveler. As a result, my time in the personal projects bucket was zero. My high time in the house chores bucket was driven by some time-sensitive work around the house. My time in the other activities bucket was mostly on watching Ninja Nerd videos, but also includes some time spent chatting with others.'),
  ('2024-05-27','This week was much higher than usual on day job, primarily driven by preparation for a potential upcoming work trip, including travel preparation as well as technical preparation. This preparation also indirectly contributed a little bit to my personal chores time, as I used the opportunity to make some general improvements to my travel processes. As a result, I spent very little time on personal projects, with the only time that I did spend being related to change-of-month tasks. My time in house chores was related to some one-off house issues. My time in the other activities bucket was primarily driven by continued watching of Ninja Nerd videos as well as other health videos, but I also spent some time chatting with a friend.'),

This significantly disrupted my schedule, with a significant increase in time spent on day job and on personal chores, and with a lot of my work time going into travel. Even the weekend, after my return, was spent on a mix of followup tasks to the travel and getting back to normal on other fronts. As a result of all this, I spent no time on personal projects and my time in the other activities bucket was also lower than usual as it included very little time watching Ninja Nerd videos.'),
  ('2024-06-10','This week was heavy on personal chores, mostly due to a mix of wrap-up from the Portland trip last week, a bunch of monthly tasks, some of which I might otherwise have spread across weeks, and meal prep getting bunched up a little bit (partly due to the Portland trip). My time in the other activities bucket was high mainly because of a long (mostly non-work) conversation on Wednesday with work colleagues. My time on day job was fairly normal.

So, this is the one week out of the four per quarter that I would like to use in this sort of way. My time on personal chores was higher than usual, partly due to the "building" work related to travel research and trip planning, and partly due to a trip for Amazon package pickup. My time on personal finances, income, and taxes was higher than usual, partly due to "building" work on India-side taxes, as well as for a few other things. My time on day job was normal, about half-way between the minimum and maximum targets; the reason it was significantly higher than the minimum was some additional stuff that came in on the weekend.

  ('2024-06-24','This week was somewhat high on personal chores, mostly due to Amazon package pickup and a failed Goodwill disposal trip. It was also very high in the other activities bucket, mostly due to a  bunch of one-off calls and meetings (that generally happen less than once in two months). My time in the day job bucket was pretty normal, around the middle of the range. As a result of all these, my time on personal projects was below my threshold of four hours; however, the extra meeting time over three hours can be counted toward the threshold and with this counting, I was over the threshold of four hours.'),

I did spend a little less time on personal chores than in the past few weeks, reflecting the completion of a bunch of one-off tasks, though this week still had the relatively one-off Tdap booster dose as well as a bunch of monthly tasks. The amount of time I spent this week on personal chores, though less than the past few weeks, is still around or a little higher than the level I want to sustain going forward.

In fact, I exceeded the 1-week, 3-week, and 5-week average targets for time spent on personal finances, income and taxes, though I''m not worried about this given that the work in the past few weeks was a mix of one-off and annual work, and similar stuff should not happen frequently. I spent way more time than usual and than my target on personal projects, with the bulk of the time going toward making progress on devops stuff, building on the momentum of the past few weeks. I also spent time doing some long-awaited work in the family and career planning space. I also spent more time than usual watching Ninja Nerd videos. On the personal chores front, I did a bunch of monthly and quarterly tasks, including quarterly tasks that I was starting off or doing a second time, so that they were more involved than they should be going forward. The front where I spent way less time than usual was the day job; however, counting two hours of time from personal devops stuff puts me above the weekly absolute minimum target, and the three-week average and five-week average are both above the respective conditional minimum targets, even without using personal devops time.

On the personal chores front, I was within my weekly maximum target, but I did spend more time than I''d like to spend on an ongoing basis. Most of my excess time is explained by personal devops work and formulation of some health-related best practices; I also did some of the month change checklist cleaning items, though this is not too atypical.

  ('2024-07-29','This week was close to normal with a few oddities. My time on day job was less than usual, primarily due to a lull in work and also due to my spending time on other things, though most of them weren''t time-sensitive. I still hit my absolute minimum and, after using the two hours on personal devops, hit my conditional minimum five-week average. My time in the other activities bucket was higher than usual; although I spent less time than usual on the usual stuff in the other activities bucket (such as watching Ninja Nerd videos, chatting with parents) I spent way more time on a meeting in San Francisco. My time on personal projects was the highest it has been in 2024, and I hope to have more weeks like this! This includes a bunch of time making significant progress on mostly one-time devops stuff (MediaWiki upgrades) as well as timelines edits, that I hope to make a more regular feature of my life. My time in the personal finances, income and taxes bucket includes some annual and one-off tax work, end-of-month balances calculation, and some one-off financial setup work.

I was high on personal projects (a good thing); my work included a mix of devops work and some thinking and strategy work on timelines wiki.

I was also higher on personal finances than my expected steady state, due to a mix of one-off and annual tax work that should wrap up in a few more weeks. My time on other activities was a little lower than usual due to less time watching Ninja Nerd than usual as well as a shorter chat with my parents. My day job time was above the minimum though not super-high. I expect that once the tax stuff wraps up and I get to a slightly better steady state with personal chores, I''ll be able to, on average, continue devoting a similar amount of time to personal projects (and also on more fun parts of personal projects as the devops work wraps up!) while spending a little more time on other activities and day job.'),

This was also a heavy week on personal chores, coming from a mix of the usual stuff and a bunch of one-off health research and recording work related to the purchase of the FoodMarble Aire 2. It was also a heavy week in the other activities bucket, due to a mix of continued medical education time (watching videos) and time spent across different meetings and calls, many of which have a cadence of less than once a month.

My overall time on personal projects was fairly normal, but the nature of the time was different from the usual, with a lot of the time going into meetings.

My time on personal chores was a little higher than normal, mostly due to blood tests https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2024/2024-09-03-blood-tests.md on Tuesday 2024-09-03.'),
  ('2024-09-09','This week was a little high on personal finances (mostly related to US tax work) and other activities (mostly periodic conversations (including one that''s about once a month) and continued medical education (this was mostly multiplexed with meal prep, eating, or exercising, so it didn''t directly eat into time for other things)). My time on day job was well above the minimum. Due to these factors, my time on personal projects was not as high as in the past few weeks, though still well above the minimum. Within personal projects, most of my time was on devops stuff and contract work management; the devops stuff is expected to continue for a few more weeks and the contract work management for a few more months. I expect my time on personal finances and other activities to drop quite a bit for the next few weeks. I expect to use the freed-up time to catch up on a bunch of pending personal chores (including monthly tasks) while approximately sustaining my time on personal projects (though it may dip a little bit while I focus on catching up on personal chores).'),
  ('2024-09-16','This week was heavy on day job, with roughly the first half of the week focused on diagnosing and fixing a time-sensitive issue, and the remaining weekdays spent catching up on regular work tasks that I had to defer for it. In the latter part of the week, I caught up on a bunch of personal chores that I had skipped in the previous month, including various recall tasks. I also took the chance to improve the list of tasks for future months. As a result of these, my time on day job and personal chores were both high. I continued to spend time on medical education, mostly multiplexed with eating, so that it did not compete with other time. Primarily due to the high time on day job and personal chores, I spent very little time on personal projects. Nonetheless, my time on personal projects met my three-week conditional minimum target.'),
  ('2024-09-23','This week was heavy on day job, with roughly the first half of the week focused on diagnosing and fixing a time-sensitive issue, and the remaining weekdays spent catching up on regular work tasks that I had to defer for it (in this respect it is similar to the previous week, though the specific issue this week was different). In the latter part of the week, I caught up with a lot of my month change checklist items, finishing almost all of them, and readying myself for a return to spending time on personal projects. While my time in the other activities bucket was very high, a lot of this was listening to videos multiplexed with eating and cleaning time, which I normally don''t track, so it was additive to total time tracked without interfering with the other buckets, and a lot of the rest was multiplexed with cooking, which meant an effective underestimation of time on personal chores. However, I do think that the significant cognitive effort of following the videos may have reduced my energy for other tasks in principle. However, it was a good fit since the kinds of tasks I was doing over this week were relatively mechanical. In future weeks, I may have to cut down on the volume of listening to these videos when I want to preserve brain energy for more intellectually demanding tasks. As a result of the day job, focus on month change checklist items, and maybe the brain fatigue due to listening to videos, I ended up spending very little time on personal projects, but expect this to change in the coming weeks. I ended up being well below my one-week and three-week conditional minimum targets and just slightly below my five-week conditional minimum target for personal projects.'),
  ('2024-09-30','After a couple of atypical weeks, this was close to an ideal week in terms of time distribution between buckets. My time on day job was well above the conditional minimum but not too high. I spent a lot of time on personal projects, mostly on end-of-month contract work stuff and devops stuff (website migration and related cleanup). My high time in the other activities bucket was mostly on watching and listening to videos during meals, meal prep, and post-meal cleanup, and didn''t reduce my time for other things, though it may have resulted in a slight underestimation of personal chores time.'),
  ('2024-10-07','This week was heavy on personal chores, including my dental cleaning appointment https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/events/2024/2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md and actions surrounding that, as well as a bunch of time spent on my best practices documents. My time on personal projects was less than my weekly conditional minimum and I also did not meet my conditional minimums for 3, 5, 7, or 9 weeks (though the gap wasn''t super-huge). However, I consider the best practices documentation work as being work of a "building" nature, and taking that into consideration (as I am allowed to do from time to time) I am above the 4 hours for personal projects. My time in the other activities bucket was high -- largely including time spent passively listening to videos -- and limits I am placing on this time going forward should reduce it in coming weeks, giving me more cognitive and physical bandwidth to do other tasks. My time spent on day job was fairly normal.'),
  ('2024-10-14','This was the first full week after the implementation of better time and effort management practices (that https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md and https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md document) with the goal of helping me reduce situations where I end up staying up late or doing too many things in one day due to poor planning. This was also the first weekend where I instituted the practice (that https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/c0c5f9d91b64752177a5feb2a9ea7711e41771ee documents) of not doing a lot of optional personal chores tasks during the weekend. All these practices were successfully implemented this week. My overall time on personal projects was just above the conditional minimum for a week, and it was able to get there thanks to me pausing optional personal chores work on the weekend, despite not being able to spend much time on it during the week. My time on other activities was fairly high; the majority of this time was on medical education, but the delta over a typical week was due to two periodic conversations (frequency monthly and once every few months) that happened to fall this week. My time on day job was a few minutes short of my weekly conditional minimum, but comfortably within my three-week conditional minimum (it would also have gotten into the conditional minimum if I had counted two hours from personal projects devops work as I am allowed to do); again, the reason it fell short of my weekly conditional minimum was the huge amount of time in periodic conversations. My time on personal chores continued to be higher than in ideal steady state, due to continued one-off health-related work.'),
  ('2024-10-21','This was the week I wrapped up my Linode migration, an effort that had taken over two years. Thus, even though my personal projects time spent was only slightly above the weekly conditional minimum, I felt like it was a productive use of time. My time on day job was within my 5-week conditional minimum, though below my 1-week and 3-week conditional minimum. My time on personal chores was high, with a lot of this due to one-off or infrequent stuff including document pouch cleanup and my annual flu shot, as well as some ongoing improvements to health recording. My time in the other activities bucket was a mix of medical education and one-off and periodic conversations, and was roughly in line with my goals. Overall, this week was reasonable, though I hope and expect that I can increase my time spent on personal projects in future weeks, since I''ll be spending less time in most weeks on one-off personal chores tasks.'),
  ('2024-10-28','This week was relatively low in total accounted-for time compared to the past few weeks, though more in line with the levels in August 2024 and earlier. The reduction in time was across the board (with the exception of day job that was stable). It partly reflects a more fragmented week as I was catching up on personal chores tasks that had bunched up from the past week. While these tasks didn''t take a lot of clock time (and some of it was multiplexed with the other activities bucket), they did fragment the rest of my time and made it harder for me to do longer stretches of work on my day job and personal projects. I did not meet my condition minimum for personal projects this week, but expect to be able to meet it in future weeks and consider this week to be anomalous (moreover, even within personal projects, my time was mostly focused on end-of-month tasks). For day job, I was just a few minutes below my 1-week conditional minimum and comfortably below my 7-week conditional minimum. For personal chores, I was pretty comparable with the past few weeks, with the qualitative difference that routine cyclic personal chores were high this week, and the more one-off kinds of personal chores were a little lower than the past few weeks (though still higher than expected in steady state). The other activities bucket was lower than the past few weeks, but within the expected range; most of this time was medical education and conversations (one-off and periodic).'),
  ('2024-11-04','This week was comparable to the previous week in total accounted-for time, and less than the preceding weeks. The primary reason for this was that I got an Amazon Prime subscription for a week and therefore used a large portion of meal time and meal prep time to watch subscription-gated content, thereby reducing my medical education time during meals. My time on day job was above the one-week conditional minimum, though I ended up needing to spend time on day job on Sunday to achieve this. My time in the personal chores bucket continued to be high as it had been in the past few weeks, though for different reasons: I spent this week doing a bunch of bureaucratic work that is relatively rare, and most of it is wrapped up for the time being (though some of it will continue into the coming weeks). Additionally, I also did some shopping tasks that are less frequent than weekly. My time in the other activities bucket was high, and the impact on the rest of my time was even more than it looks: less time on medical education (that is efficiently multiplexed and doesn''t detract from my ability to do other things) and more time on a call on Saturday. The net effect of all these was that I ended up spending very little time on personal projects this week (well below my conditional minimum), with the time spent being limited to handling monthly todo tasks. However, this was a deliberate trade-off and I think that I am well-positioned to get personal projects back to desired levels in future weeks where there is less of a confluence of excessive time on personal chores and other activities.'),
  ('2024-11-11','This week was a little higher than usual in personal chores, with the increase partly coming from work early in the week on administrative tasks, including two outside trips over and above my usual trips, as well as ongoing health streamlining work (not motivated by ill health). Also, my baseline amount of work in the realms of cooking and food purchases increased with the cold weather increasing my appetite. The week was also high in the other activities bucket, driven partly by a monthly meeting and a one-off meeting; other than those, it was the usual medical education. My time on day job was above my conditional minimum target; in addition, 3 hours that I spent on personal projects count at 50% toward my conditional minimum, which might be helpful when averaging for future weeks even though I didn''t need them for this week. My time on personal projects was below my target conditional minimum of 4 hours, but only slightly, with the gap explained by the extra time in the personal chores and other activities buckets.'),
  ('2024-11-18','This week was back to being close to my ideal on personal chores (given the extra cooking/food purchases load induced by cold weather), which was partly due to the luck of having fewer meal preps scheduled (because meal preps happened right before and right after); there continued to be a few one-off items including dumb bell purchase and 23andMe data processing, but the time contributions of these items were not too high. My time on day job was higher than in recent weeks, which reflected me getting in the flow on Friday and continuing a little bit into Saturday to take advantage of the flow. In addition, about 2 hours 25 minutes of personal projects time can be counted at 50% toward work. My total time on personal projects continued to be below my conditional minimum target, but this was based on a deliberate trade-off where I opted to do more day job work; the extra time on day job puts me in a better position to spend more time on personal projects in the next week, which is also Thanksgiving week. My time on other activities was a bit lower than usual, reflecting fewer one-off conversations as well as a slight reduction in medical education video watch time, as I switch to binging Netflix while my subscription to it is active.'),
  ('2024-11-25','This week I met all my minimum targets. As it was a short week for Thanksgiving, my absolute minimum target for day job work was just 3 hours, and I achieved that total of 3 hours before the Thanksgiving break, so my focus shifted away from work. However, I ended up crossing 4.5 hours anyway due to a few small things that happened over the Thanksgiving break. I also spent 5 hours on personal projects work that I can count at 50% toward my conditional minimum, giving me a comfortable buffer in terms of day job hours. I also comfortably hit my conditional minimum for personal projects hours. My time in the personal chores bucket was a little higher than usual, which was largely due to more food preparation bunching up in the week (last week was a little lower for the same reason) as well as my work on month change checklist items that I had deferred to this week (when I had more time due to the Thanksgiving break). Some of my personal chores time was spent optimizing my exercise routine and month change checklists to reduce the time spent on these moving forward. My time in the other activities bucket was comparable to most recent weeks, though higher than last week; most of this time was spent on health learning. I also made a few adjustments, all in the upward direction, to more accurately reflect my time spent on some personal chores activities including grocery shopping and laundry.'),
  ('2024-12-02','This week I met all my minimum targets. My time on day job was comfortably above both my absolute and conditional minimum, giving me a bit of a buffer to use for future weeks. My time on personal projects was well above my conditional minimum, and it means I need to spend very little time on personal projects in the coming week to meet my conditional minimum. However, a large chunk of this personal projects time was on Groupprops subwiki editing which was a very engrossing activity, and it doesn''t reflect a significant increase in calendar time availability for personal projects. My time in the personal chores bucket was a bit lower than past weeks, and closer to what I expect in the longer term. My time in the other activities bucket was comparable to previous weeks; it was mostly a mix of health learning and periodic conversations.'),

I also spent a lot of time in the other activities bucket, driven partly by a once-a-month catch-up with work colleagues and partly by increased time on health learning multiplexed with personal chores (so the personal chores time is correspondingly underestimated -- it would be even higher if not for the multiplexing). I still got above my conditional 1-week minimum for day job. On the personal projects front, I spent very little time, but still got the most time-sensitive pieces done, and was above my conditional 3-week minimum due to more time spent on personal projects in the past two weeks. This reduced time on personal projects was a conscious choice so that I stayed on top of personal chores.'),
  ('2024-12-16','This week was heavy on day job and personal chores. The greater time on day job was driven by a number of time-sensitive items coming up with the day job, as well as more time spent on weekly roundup tasks, partly due to these time-sensitive items. The greater time on personal chores was driven by a mix of increased winter load (more time on cyclic personal chores, particularly cooking and food purchases), processing of blood test results, some other streamlining work, and Amazon package pickup. My time in the other activities bucket was high, but comparable to the past few weeks. It was mostly on health learning multiplexed with eating, post-meal cleanup, meal prep, and exercise, and therefore means that my time on personal chores is effectively somewhat underestimated. As a result of these, my time on personal projects was way less than my target.'),

This included cyclic personal chores load as well as a lot of time on health-related stuff, including actions related to my hearing issues as well as continued processing of my blood test results. The week was relatively light on day job to begin with, but I spent a bunch of time on Sunday making progress on long-standing threads in order to get a head start ahead of a busy Q1 2025. My time in the other activities bucket was high, driven primarily by a lot of time on health learning, including some learning around hearing-related stuff and other ongoing health learning (medical school curriculum education and health optimization space education). I did not spend any time in the buckets of personal projects, personal finances, house chores, and career and family planning. The zero time on personal projects is consistent with my temporary suspension of minimum targets for personal projects.'),

The week continued to be busy on the personal chores front, though a little less than last week''s extreme; some of this time was spent wrapping up month change checklist items. The busyness on the other activities front was a result of a mix of time spent on health learning and a monthly periodic conversation that happened to fall in this week. Time on personal finances was mostly on the "downloading" portion of year-end stuff, which is the most time-sensitive due to lookback limitations imposed by financial institutions. My time on personal projects continued to be low due to all these other things.'),

I was also quite behind on contract work data entry and end-of-month finances, so I devoted the weekend (outside of cyclic personal chores) to those, pausing catchup on my day job. As a result, my time on day job was on the low end, though still above my weekly conditional minimum. My time on personal chores was high (with the delta driven by the audiological evaluation).

My time on day job continued to be a little high, mostly driven by some setup work done in preparation for increased workload in the coming weeks.

My time in the other activities bucket was a little lower than in recent weeks; this mostly reflected reduced time on health learning, while my time on periodic conversations was fairly typical. The reduced time on health learning reflected more of my meal and post-meal time being spent watching TV shows or reading and watching / listening to other stuff that I don''t track time for.

  ('2025-02-03','This week continued to be high on day job, reflecting the increase in day job time for Q1 2025.

My time in the other activities bucket, though higher than the previous week, was lower than earlier weeks, due to a mix of fewer cyclic personal chores and more time spent on reading and watching videos in areas where I don''t track time (most of this being multiplexed with meals, meal prep, and post-meal cleanup, but some of it also impinged on hands-on computer time). I also started picking up my backlog of month change checklist items related to personal projects and personal finances.

My time in the other activities bucket was consistent with recent weeks (except the last two that were a bit lower), combining more time than usual on periodic conversations (due to one long monthly meeting that happened to be this week) and slightly less time than usual on health learning, as I''ve been using my meal times for a more diverse range of consumption, most of which I don''t time-track.

Monday was a holiday for the day job (Presidents'' Day) so my absolute minimum for the week was just 4.5 hours, and my conditional minimum was even lower due to working above the minimum for the past 4 weeks. I was able to clear these minimums and also take care of all my weekly tasks, but I didn''t make progress through the backlog. I spent a lot of time on personal chores, including 9 cyclic personal chores as well as 5 other outside trips (1 to Whole Foods, 2 to Berkeley Bowl, 1 to Walgreens, and 1 to Sports Basement). In the latter half of the week, the weather got warmer, reducing my appetite and sleep needs, which in turn meant less time on cyclic personal chores and more time for other stuff. A lot of this extra time was used on cyclic personal chores and the outside trips mentioned above; I also used some of this time to adjust my sleep cycle to earlier, and I used some of it for month change checklist items that had accumulated from the busy past few weeks (most of this is under personal chores). Some of the extra personal chores time got counted in the other activities bucket due to multiplexing meal prep with watching and listening to videos.

This was mostly due to more time than usual spent on personal finances, that in turn was due to an unexpected financial anomaly investigation.
