  ('2020-11-09','I had somewhat fewer work hours than usual, largely because I spent a significant amount of time on house chores and a large amount of time on other activities not tied to my personal projects, finances, or chores.'),
  ('2020-11-16',NULL),
  ('2020-11-23','I had fewer work hours than any week since I resumed hours tracking on 2020-03-09. This was mostly due to a significant amount of time on house chores and a large ammount of time on other activities not tied to my personal projects, finances, or chores.'),
  ('2020-11-30','I had fewer work hours than any week since I resumed hours tracking on 2020-03-09. The reason was two-fold: a significant amount of time wrapping up personal finances, a moderate amount of time on house chores due to a house situation, and a significant amount of time on other activities not tied to my personal projects, finances, or chores.'),
  ('2020-12-07','I had fewer accounted-for-hours than in a typical week; this was due to general end-of-year fatigue and declining work load. I also spent time on personal chores such as getting my state ID card.'),
  ('2020-12-14','I had fewer accounted-for-hours than in a typical week; this was due to a mix of increased time on house chores, that fatigued me more, and general end-of-year fatigue and declining work load. I also spent more time on personal projects than I had since July.'),
  ('2020-12-21','I had fewer day job hours than in any week since March; this was largely due to reduced workload and the additional Christmas holidays. The freed-up time went to a mix of house chores, backups, and the launch of https://ese.vipulnaik.com/ that I had been planning to do for some time. Very little went to the personal projects category.'),
  ('2020-12-28','My time on house chores went down now that a tenant was secured and started move-in. On the other hand, I spent a lot of time on end-of-year finalizations, mostly on personal finances, income and taxes. Officially, there were only three working days, and I ended up working for only a small part of the official holidays.'),
  ('2021-01-04','I had a somewhat unusual week; I spent a little more weekday time on non-work tasks, including weekly meal prep. However, I spent the weekend almost entirely on work.'),
  ('2021-01-11','This was a relatively low-energy week where I spent very little non-work time, but still had an average amount of work time spent.'),
  ('2021-01-18','I spent a lot of time this weekend on discussions and research related to health (this shows up in the other activities bucket). There was no particular urgency; I do expect to do a review of this sort every so often.'),
  ('2021-01-25','I picked up one of my personal projects that had been paused since July 2020 (work on migration policy and history). This did not eat up too much into other uses of my time, as I was overall more energetic this week and thus ended up having a more "productive" weekend.'),
  ('2021-02-01','Unlike the previous few weeks, I spent a lot of time on a house matter; this extra time came mainly at the expense of work time. Also, the end-of-month transition meant a little bit more time on personal projects and personal finances.'),
  ('2021-02-08','I spent five hours on the weekend drafting my US federal and California state income tax returns (based on preliminary calculations done back in January). This mostly ate into weekend time that I would normally spend on work.'),
  ('2021-02-15','The shadow of taxes continued: I spent a lot of time on Monday (officially a work holiday) on updating tax information in the contract work repository, and also spent time on Saturday wrapping up my tax filing. I was also able to wrap up data entry backfill for my health records. I did not spend time on the weekend cooking; as a result, I spent slightly more unduplexed time watching MasterClass and Viki.'),
  ('2021-02-22','This week had a smaller number of total accounted hours than usual, partly because of a relaxed Saturday and also because, during the week, I worked at the lower end of normal but did not use the freed-up time for any other accounted activities. Mostly, I was taking things a little bit slower.'),
  ('2021-03-01','Over the weekend, I spent a lot of time during the day lazing around, watching Encounter (Korean drama) and rewatching some episodes of Gilmore Girls. This partly explains my lower total accounted-for time over the week.'),
  ('2021-03-08','Time-sensitive tasks in the realms of house chores and other activities ended up taking way more time than usual, leading to a reduction in total time spent at work.'),
  ('2021-03-15','Time-sensitive activities involving a friend ended up taking a large share of my time this week. My total work time was therefore a little on the low end; I also ended up spending no time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-03-22','Time-sensitive activities involving a friend ended up taking a large share of my time this week. My total work time was close to normal; most of the hit was taken in my time spent on personal projects and there was also an increase in my total accounted time spent.'),
  ('2021-03-29','The main highlights outside the work front were end-of-month tasks, some house matters, and wrapping up of time-sensitive activities involving a friend.'),
  ('2021-04-05','I continued to get more on top of work, wrapping up my planned work for the week by Saturday. Sunday was a bit slow, wrapping up some important but drudge-ish work on nutrition, but I finally got around to updating my standing plan and returning to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-04-12','I spent more time than usual chatting with friends; this cut a little bit (but not too much) into work time.'),
  ('2021-04-19','I had a relatively normal amount of work time; slightly on the lower end during the week, compensated by slightly on the higher end during the weekend.'),
  ('2021-04-26','I spent a large chunk of time on two weekdays working on personal projects, explaining the greater total time spent on personal projects. My overall accounted time spent was lower than normal, partly because of less accounted time on weekends and partly because the change to increase time on personal projects led to some overhead of inefficiency.'),
  ('2021-05-03','I spent more of my weekend time working than usual.'),
  ('2021-05-10','I had somewhat-lower-than-usual total-accounted-for-hours, mostly due to some inefficiencies during the week. I didn''t spend time on personal projects or personal finances at all.'),
  ('2021-05-17','I did two rounds of cooking (and also correspondingly two rounds of food purchase) so I spent more time on personal chores than usual. The increased time came mostly at the expense of my time spent on work. I spent almost no time on personal projects and personal finances, similar to the previous week.'),
  ('2021-05-24','I spent a lot of time on disposal of items (clothes, e-waste, recycling containers) and as a result I had less time available for work and other activities. I also got my COVID shot. On Sunday, I spent a lot of time watching the TV show Startup on Netflix, resulting in lower total-accounted-for-time for the week.'),
  ('2021-05-31','I spent a lot of time on personal projects, partly because of Monday being a holiday for Memorial Day and partly because of the experimentation with reducing my work time to 75% of what it used to be. I also did two rounds of meal prep instead of one, leading to more time on personal chores than usual.'),
  ('2021-06-07','I continued to spend a lot of time on personal projects, as part of the experimentation with reducing my work time to 75% of what it used to be. I also had somewhat lower accounted-for-time than usual overall, partly as a result of overhead from the adjustment to the new routine.'),
  ('2021-06-14','This week I returned to a closer-to-normal amount of work time, correspondingly reducing my time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-06-21','I went back down to 75% work time, not fully intentionally (I was hoping to be closer to 90%). Most of the remaining time was not spent on personal projects; it was spent on a mix of personal chores (including getting and recovering from the COVID vaccine) and other activities.'),
  ('2021-06-28','I worked a little less even than my target 75% work time, mostly because I had reached a logical point with various work-related activities. I expect to do some more work in future weeks based on what fits naturally, so that the average evens out.'),
  ('2021-07-05','I worked more than my target 75% work time, partly to make up for less work than planned in previous weeks, and partly because I wanted to get ahead on time-sensitive tasks.'),
  ('2021-07-12','I worked a little bit overtime to make progress on some time-sensitive day job stuff. I had correspondingly less time for personal projects.'),
  ('2021-07-19','I worked around 100% (rather than my long-term reduced 75%) for a few reasons: (a) to make progress on time-sensitive day job stuff, (b) to cancel out early start of reduced time in June (official plan had been to start from July), and (c) to be better prepared for likely disruptions in the next few weeks.'),
  ('2021-07-26','I worked a little over my reduced (75%) time but still keeping the spirit of it by taking out a fair amount of time for personal projects. My personal projects time (not including work related to the change of month) was early in the week, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so I ended up spending time on work on Sunday.'),
  ('2021-08-02','My work hours came to my expected 75% time; however, I did not get much time for personal projects. I ended up spending a lot of time on house-related items, and also had a few meetings that fall under "other activities".'),
  ('2021-08-09','A combination of dentist trip plus followup (showing up under personal chores) and house stuff (showing up under house chores) took a large share of my time, causing my work time to fall to a little below the target 75%. In addition, partly due to fatigue and boredom, I couldn''t get to spend even my limited free time on personal projects, and I ended up instead spending it on other activities.'),
  ('2021-08-16','Like the previous week, this week was also heavy on personal chores, house chores, and other activities, but future weeks are expected to be relatively light on these fronts, allowing for a greater degree of return to personal projects. My work time was still a little below the target 75%, but I did spend some time on personal projects (albeit on Groupprops, which is not one of the two main personal projects I am focusing on).'),
  ('2021-08-23','With some house-related stuff wrapping up, I spent extra time on my day job (100%+ instead of target 75%); this helped me more than catch up on day job in terms of number of hours. I expect to return to my usual 75% on the day job in coming weeks, and use the time thus freed up to return to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-08-30','I returned more to what I expect my usual routine to be. Though I did spend more work hours than I expect to average, I also resumed work on personal projects, devoting a large portion of my Sunday to personal projects.'),
  ('2021-09-06','My total accounted time spent was much lower than usual. This is partly explained by my spending Monday on personal projects that were a little difficult to concentrate on, and consequently multiplexing with watching Netflix. I similarly multiplexed day job work on the weekend with watching Netflix. Despite the low-seeming total, I feel I had a fairly rounded week in terms of making progress on personal projects while not being too far below my target of 75% of work time for the day job.'),
  ('2021-09-13','My total accounted time spent was much lower than usual. This is partly explained by my spending Sunday on personal projects that were a little difficult to concentrate on, and consequently multiplexing with listening to podcasts and interviews. Even earlier in the week, I engaged in similar multiplexing, leading to reduced work efficiency and less accounted-for-time. See https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList for more information on my consumption.'),
  ('2021-09-20','This week was a deliberate experiment on my part with reducing work hours even more to spend more time on personal projects. I spent more time on personal projects than in any week on record since I started tracking the time a year ago. I also spent less time on work than I have in any fully recorded week. Despite these firsts, I did not develop any backlog nor did I leave any of my work colleagues blocked. The experiment was overall a success and I might do it in the future as well. The next experiment to try is taking more continuous time off work which would enable me to do pieces of personal projects that need longer stretches of time. I also spent double-time on personal chores (shopping, cooking) just as a result of timing of various things.'),
  ('2021-09-27','I spent many hours in the week dealing with personal chores (dentist trip) and house chores (toilet clog).'),
  ('2021-10-04','I spent much more time than usual on personal chores, including three rounds of meal prep and a dentist trip. I still worked a little over my 75% work hours, so personal projects took the biggest hit.'),
  ('2021-10-11','This week was partly a deliberate experiment with reducing work hours in order to spend more time on personal projects, but it also happened to be a week where I had some time-sensitive tasks in the "other activities" bucket.'),
  ('2021-10-18','This week was qualitatively similar to the previous week: I spent a lot of time on personal projects as well as in the "other activities" bucket, so my work hours fell short of the 75% target. I expect to return to a normal level of work hours by the next week or the week after. I expect that this will be via the "other activities" bucket subsiding, and I will continue to be able to spend a comparable amount of time on personal projects.'),
  ('2021-10-25','My "other activities" bucket did not end up subsiding, but the previous sources of "other activities" did subside -- there was just an increase in one-off "other activities"; I also had a one-off eye exam appointment that took some time. Overall, I ended up spending a little less time on work than my target 75% time, but within the range.'),
  ('2021-11-01','As anticipated, my time in other activities started subsiding, and much of this saved time got directed to personal projects. However, my time on personal projects this week was spent more on one-off activities than on ongoing projects.'),
  ('2021-11-08','This was a relatively normal week; part of the reason for the low total-accounted-for-time was that on Sunday I went to downtown San Francisco (see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commit/8f6632aad2e3c24c607efc42381bd6d82987d193 for details) and only part of the trip time is accounted-for.'),
  ('2021-11-15','This was a relatively normal week; the mix of time spent across activities is close to what I target on average.'),
  ('2021-11-22','The official work week was shorter than usual on account of Thanksgiving. However, I did spend much of the Thanksgiving break doing some longer-form day job work (reading and understanding code for a ticket I intend to work on) so my total work hours were only slightly less than my typical weekly target.'),
  ('2021-11-29','This was a relatively typical week, with a couple of nuances: (a) end-of-month updates took up a large share of my personal project time, and (b) I ended up doing grocery shopping and  meal prep twice, but one of the meal prep times was largely multiplexed with work, so the effect on my personal chores time was minimal.'),
  ('2021-12-06','This was a relatively typical week, though my work hours were a little lower than usual, and time spent on "other activities" was a little higher than usual.'),
  ('2021-12-13','This week, I spent a fair amount of time on personal projects (most of the weekend and a large part of two weekdays), so my day job time spent was much lower than my typical weekly target. I also spent more time on personal chores than usual, with a dentist trip and two rounds each of grocery shopping and meal prep.'),
  ('2021-12-20','This week was unusual in a few respects: the work week was shorter due to Christmas, and I took much of Thursday and almost all of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday almost off from work other than ongoing tasks. I also got my COVID booster dose on Friday; see https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2021-12-24-pfizer-covid-vaccine-booster-dose.md for more details.'),
  ('2021-12-27','This was an unusual week, with just three official working days, due to Christmas and New Year''s. Most of my work was only on the official working days. In addition to personal projects, I spent a lot of time on other activities, including chatting with friends and consuming a MasterClass Session. I also spent a fair amount of time on end-of-year finances work.'),
  ('2022-01-03','This was a fairly typical week albeit with more time on other activities instead of personal projects. Although Monday was a holiday from work, I still did the equivalent of a full week of work by working a little extra on the weekend.'),
  ('2022-01-10','This was a week with a lot of time spent on other activities (meetings with friends); this did cut a little bit into my work hours but the overall effect was to increase my accounted time spent.'),
  ('2022-01-17','This was a typical week work-wise; however, I spent a lot more time on other activities and a lot less time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-01-24','This was a much-busier-than-usual week work-wise, with the amount of time on work comparable to what I used to spend in Q1/Q2 2021, before reducing work time. I also spent a fair amount of time in the other activities bucket, and very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-01-31','This was a fairly busy week work-wise, comparable to Q1/Q2 2021, before reducing work time, and similar to the previous week. I also spent a lot of time arranging my travel history and getting various documents together, most of which went under "personal chores"; my time on "other activities" was less than the last few weeks but higher than my historical steady state; I expect it to be representative of my steady state for the next few months.'),
  ('2022-02-07','This was a typical week work-wise. I spent way more time than usual on personal finances, mainly working on my 2021 taxes. I also spent a lot of time on house chores, way more than I had anticipated spending. My "other activities" was similar to last week, so "personal projects" was the main area that suffered.'),
  ('2022-02-14','This was a typical week work-wise. Like the previous week, I spent way more time than usual on personal finances, mainly working on my 2021 taxes, but I succeeded in wrapping it up so future weeks should be relatively free of personal finances work. I began formally recording my time spent related to Equator, that I was planning to join part-time in a couple of months. Of the buckets, "personal projects" was the main one that suffered.'),
  ('2022-02-21','This week was somewhat on the lower end work-wise, but still within range, and somewhat higher than usual on the preparatory work for Equator, but still within range. As with previous weeks, "personal projects" continued to suffer.'),
  ('2022-02-28','This week was very low on day job, for several reasons. The Equator WeWork get together contributed to the high amount of time on Equator preparatory work. "House chores" was a little higher than usual as I was cleaning stuff out after the departure of two housemates. A power cut on Friday disrupted my schedule somewhat. Finally, unlike previous weeks, I did take out some time for personal projects. Combined, all these factors led to a lower amount of time on the day job.'),
  ('2022-03-07','My time on day job was pretty normal. My time on "other activities" was higher than usual even compared to recent weeks, partly due to a lunch with work colleagues and partly because I spent time reading and thinking about things.'),
  ('2022-03-14','This was a relatively normal week compared to the standard set by previous weeks. In particular, time on day job was normal, and time on Equator preparatory work was comparable to the last couple of months.'),
  ('2022-03-21','The weekday portion of the week was fairly normal, but the weekend was unusual with a large amount of time spent on personal finances and on house chores (apartment search).'),
  ('2022-03-28','The weekday portion of the week was fairly normal (other than time early in the week on apartment search), but the weekend was unusual with a large amount of time spent on personal projects (biology reading and work on the cellbio subwiki).'),
  ('2022-04-04','This was an unusual week, with a huge proportion of time spent on personal chores (dealing with cracked phone screen, getting new phone and laptop) and house chores (working out my house move). I spent less time than usual on day job, personal projects, and other activities.'),
  ('2022-04-11','This week, I spent a lot of time in work related to my house move. This cut into my time on work (both my LiftIgniter / Arena Group work and my preparatory work for Equator), personal projects, and other activities.'),
  ('2022-04-18','This was the week that I moved house, so I spent a lot of time on the move and on related disposal and cleanup work. It was also the week that I started part-time at Equator (on 2022-04-19) so starting this week, my time on LiftIgniter / Arena Group work fell and my time on Equator rose.'),
  ('2022-04-25','I continued to spend a fair amount of time on cleanup and disposal related to the house I had moved out of; this ate into my time in the various other buckets.'),
  ('2022-05-02','I spent even more time than in the past two weeks on cleanup and disposal related to the house I had moved out of; this ate into my time in the various other buckets. I finished up most of the work needed so I expect the coming week and future weeks to be closer to normal.'),
  ('2022-05-09','This was a typical week, hitting the desired distribution of time spent that I hope to maintain for the next few months.'),
  ('2022-05-16','This was a somewhat atypical week, with slightly less time on Equator than I would ideally like to spend, but more time on personal projects, most of it spent on server devops streamlining.'),
  ('2022-05-23','This week was mostly spent on Equator stuff, roughly at the level that I''d like to maintain for the next few months. I spent more time than expected on personal chores as I was dealing with stains and then eye and skin irritation; I spent very little time on personal projects.'),
  ('2022-05-30','This week was mostly spent on Equator stuff, roughly at the level that I''d like to maintain for the next few months. I also spent more time on personal projects than in the previous week (something I consider desirable).'),
  ('2022-06-06','This week was somewhat busier with The Arena Group work than the past few weeks; my Equator work suffered a little bit but not much, and the overall effect was an increase in my total accounted hours.'),
  ('2022-06-13','This was a reasonably typical week, with a few differences: I spent more time on personal chores than usual, with the extra time going into a dentist trip as well as work on scripts to check for uncommitted and unsynced changes on my laptop. I also spent more time on personal projects, including coordinating with a new funding source from the Future Fund and continued work on devops streamlining. These resulted in a little bit less time than usual for my Equator work.'),
  ('2022-06-20','This was a somewhat unusual week with much more time on personal chores than usual; most of this time was for outside trips that were one-off and were upfront investments in a better long-term setup. My work on Equator and on personal projects suffered most directly. I also spent a bit more time on personal finances, partly related to the imminent end of Q2 2022.'),
  ('2022-06-27','This week was somewhat unusual in two respects: (1) a bunch of Q3 2022 planning for LiftIgniter / The Arena Group stuff led to me spending way more time than usual on The Arena Group, (2) I spent a fair amount of time on the weekend on personal projects, mainly updating the contract work portal to better showcase other payers. Combined, these led to way less time on Equator than I had spent in previous weeks and hope to spend in coming weeks.'),
  ('2022-07-04','I spent a substantial amount of time this week on personal projects, mostly devops streamlining work and some related work. Equator work suffered a little bit as a result. I also spent a little more time on personal chores than usual; much of the extra time was driven by personal practices documentation work.'),
  ('2022-07-11','I spent some time this week on personal projects, mostly devops streamlining work wrapping up threads started over the weekend. I also spent a little more time on Arena Group work than I would like to in steady state, as well as more time on personal chores driven by personal practices documentation work. Equator work suffered due to a combination of all these.'),
  ('2022-07-18','This week, I spent an unusually large amount of time on personal projects: this was a mix of somewhat-time-sensitive work on devops streamlining, as well as not-so-time-sensitive work on the donations list website. My Equator time suffered as a result. My time on LiftIgniter / Arena was in the desired range (not too high, but high enough to deal with ongoing things).'),
  ('2022-07-25','This week, I spent an unusually large amount of time on Arena Group stuff, mostly related to transferring some responsibilities and streamlining some tasks; I expect the next few weeks to be much lower on Arena Group work. My Equator work suffered a bit as a result; I partly caught up on Equator work on Sunday but it wasn''t enough. I also ended up spending much less time than usual on personal projects and also less time than usual on personal chores (skipping one round of meal prep) to make way for the increased workload.'),
  ('2022-08-01','This week, I spent more time on personal chores than usual, mainly due to once-in-two-months Walgreens shopping, once-in-two-months Amazon package pickup, and the need for two Trader Joe''s trips because some stuff wasn''t available during my first trip. It was otherwise a fairly typical week. Since I had placed Arena Group transition/streamlining work on hold, I spent relatively little time on it, and was able to devote most of my work time to Equator.'),
  ('2022-08-08','This week, in addition to spending a lot of time on Equator (as I had hoped) I also ended up spending a lot of time on Arena Group work -- this was because I decided to get a head start on some things I had hoped to wrap up in coming weeks. I was able to keep my time spent in other buckets to a relatively low level to make room for the increased total time across day jobs, and I also ended up clocking more tracked time in total than in the past few weeks.');
