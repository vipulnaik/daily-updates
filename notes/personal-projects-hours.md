# Personal projects hours

This is a complementary document to the [standing
plan](../standing-plan-for-the-next-few-months.md). Whereas the
standing plan is a living document that only covers the current state
(as of the most recent update), this document provides more historical
context on one specific aspect: personal projects hours.

## Time supply constraints and my efforts to address them

The short summary for personal projects hours is that I'd ideally like
them to go up to a lot higher than they have been. I'm constrained by
a limited time supply, and I have tried various things (to varying
degrees of success) to address the time supply constraints.

### Reducing hours on day job

Starting July 2021 (actually effective June 2021), I reduced my target
hours on day job from a range of 24-30 down to 21. With this change, I
was able to gradually increase my personal projects hours to somewhere
between 4 and 6 hours per week. However:

* There was a lot of uncertainty and random work related to my housing
  situation.

* I still refrained from taking on a lot of big, one-off things like
  devops streamlining and Linode migration.

* I also refrained from picking up a bunch of personal finances and
  personal chores tasks (though I did get my blood tests, periodontal
  therapy, eye tests, done). For instance, I refrained from planning
  an India trip, I refrained from doing wisdom tooth removal, and I
  refrained from any major health-related stuff.

Unfortunately, this spell of relative calm was disrupted by my
decision to join Equator. My conversations with Equator started
January 2022. In addition, around February 2022, I started planning a
house move, which was also a big time sink (though it paid off in the
long run). Therefore, this semi-golden period of increased time on
personal projects lasted only until December 2021.

### Sense of urgency around devops streamlining and Linode migration

Around May 2022, after my house move, I developed a sense of urgency
around devops streamlining and Linode migration, so I started working
on it. I didn't have a lot of time in that month, but I picked up
again in July, and got really serious at the time due to a lot of
things I discovered were overdue. I had another devops-heavy month in
September. I continued working on devops in October and November, but
at some point the amount of stuff to do in Equator became clear and I
had to shelve devops stuff.

Later, this sense of urgency arose again in June 2023 when I needed to
finish the GA 4 migration.

### Long-term increase in free time starting March 2023 with the switch to half-time work, but not a lot of gain to personal projects from this

Starting March 6, 2023, I've been working part-time for The Arena
Group. This significantly increased my overall free time, but except
June 2023, until October 2023 I didn't direct much of it to personal
projects. That's because I initially used the free time to get ahead
on Arena work and wrap up Equator work, then (after devops
streamlining in June) I did my wisdom tooth removal and tax stuff
(complicated 2022 tax situation), then I did various bureaucratic and
health-related trips in October. Around September / October, I also
began planning in earnest for my February 2024 India trip.

### November 2023: living the new reality

It was around November that these tasks wrapped up or paused enough
that I could return to steady-state personal projects work. I decided
that instead of using the freed up time to immediately focus on
intense devops streamlining work, I'll try to live in my intended
future steady state, so I picked a mix of work for my personal
projects time, and also set a minimum target of 5 hours per week.

### December 2023 to March 2024: personal finances / taxes plus trip

Unfortunately, this new reality was short-lived too, and in December
2023 and January 2024 I had to return my focus to personal finances
(taxes stuff) and planning for my India trip. February and March 2024
were focused on the trip itself as well as a bunch of trip-related
bureaucracy.

### April 2024 onward

This is the time that I started steadily staying in excess of 3 hours
on personal projects each week. My time was spent on a mix of
long-pending devops work, some timelines work, and Wikipedia editing
relatedd to things I want to learn about for other purposes.

I implemented two other strategies to help drive more time
to personal projects:

* Stricter restrictions on the day job work I can do over the
  weekends, so that more of the weekends can be spent on personal
  projects.

* Weekly issues listing the personal projects work I plan to do over
  the week, for one-time projects and ongoing steady-state work.

On May 19, 2024, I reduced my weekly hours target for personal
projects for 1 / 3 / 5-week average from 5 / 5.5 / 6 to 4 / 4.25 /
4.5. The goal is not to reduce my time spent on personal projects, but
rather to switch from a target that feels like a stretch, particularly
in weeks where other stuff is going on, to a target that feels
achievable and to which I can actually hold myself accountable. This
is also expected to both increase compliance and reduce my stress
around meeting hours targets as well as my disappointment at failing
to meet them.

On October 12, 2024, I added 7-week and 9-week average cases of 4.75
and 5 hours respectively, giving myself more flexibility in how I
distribute personal projects time across weeks.

### June 2024 and early July 2024: formal recognition of exceptional conditions

From late May 2024 to mid-June 2024, I had a number of exceptional
weeks before, during and after my Portland travel, then spent some
time on setup related to taxes and travel checklists.

I noticed that during this process, I felt guilty about weeks where my
personal projects time was low for reasons that made strategic sense
to me. In order to reduce that guilt while still encouraging myself to
spend more time on personal projects, I used [this
commit](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/01c33924b7b43478e8d15d61eabe50adf0f56429)
to document allowed exceptions and their limits. At the time I did
this, the past few weeks had been examples of such exceptions, so it
was good to get formal recognition of this and reduce my guilt and
inner conflict.

In early July 2024, I added another exceptional condition with [this
commit](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commit/e3776e7b8c02c557e6480be7d9fb5e1e24b95b9a).

## Track record

### A look at months where I have had a high number of personal projects hours

As of 2024-03-15, the six recorded months where my personal projects
hours have been in excess of 6 hours per week are:

Month | One-off tasks or steady state? | Explanation
-- | -- | --
2022-09 | one-off tasks (though no deadline per se) | I was focused on devops streamlining work (related to my planned Linode migration) as I really wanted to get the migration done soon; even though it was a very busy month in other respects (leaving Arena), I squeezed the time in.
2021-12 | steady state | This was one of those ideal personal projects months; the time here was on steady-state personal projects work such as the donations list website, rather than one-off things like devops streamlining.
2023-06 | one-off tasks (with an imminent deadline) | I was focused on the work needed for Google Analytics 4 migration, in light of the sunset on Universal Analytics at the end of June.
2022-11 | mix of one-off tasks and steady state (though no deadline per se) | My time on personal projects here was related to some FTX collapse stuff, some devops stuff, etc., but I'd say a lot of it was me not being able to focus as muh on Equator as I should have and using personal projects in the downtime.
2022-07 | one-off tasks (though no deadline per se) | I spent a lot of time this month on devops streamlining. There was no imminent deadline, but some of the tasks, once started, I needed to finish.
2023-11 | steady state | This was one of those ideal personal projects months; by this time, I was in a good space with the day job, had wrapped up a lot of personal chores that had been pending for a while (including initial planning for my India trip), and also wrapped up personal finances (taxes stuff). So I started a 5-hour minimum per week on personal projects, and mostly adhered to that! Unfortunately the spell was broken the next month as I returned to personal finances (taxes) and planning for my India trip.
