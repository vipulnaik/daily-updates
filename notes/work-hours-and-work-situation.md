# Work hours and work situation

This is a complementary document to the [standing
plan](../standing-plan-for-the-next-few-months.md). Whereas the
standing plan is a living document that only covers the current state
(as of the most recent update), this work hours document provides more
historical context on one specific aspect: work hours.

## Interpretation of hour measurement

### Calendar time versus process time

I generally measure hours based on actual "process time" rather than
"calendar time". A rough rule of thumb is that calendar time is
roughly double the process time, though this can vary quite a bit (for
instance, in a focused meeting, calendar time can be equal to process
time; in a meeting I'm attending but not really listening to, process
time may be close to zero). My thresholds on process time should
therefore be interpreted in that light.

### Gradual drift in estimation methodology over time

I expect that over a period of 4 years or so, my estimation
methodology may fluctuate by around 10-20% overall.

### Changes to workflow efficiency

In general, my workflow has become more efficient over time. Some
examples include:

* **Hardware improvement**: Moving from Intel Macbooks to M1 Macbooks
  resulted in efficiency improvements, particularly for tasks that
  involve a lot of typing (since the keyboard is a lot better) but
  also for tasks that require a lot of CPU.

* **Alerts improvement**: The early phase of setup of alerts involves
  a lot of noise. Over time, the noise goes down through a combination
  of: fixes to the underlying issues, suppression of noisy sources of
  false or non-actionable alerts, and changes to alert thresholds to
  make them less noisy. So, over time, alert load is expected to go
  down, unless I'm also adding more alerts to compensate for
  this. Though I have been adding more alerts, the rate of adding new
  alerts has, on the whole, been less than the efficiency gains from
  improving existing alerts.

* **Reduced training/collaboration effort**: In previous years, I
  spent more time on training and collaboration with others. At this
  point, my effort on these fronts is lower, mostly because I've been
  working with the same team members for a long time, so we're mostly
  on the same page in many ways, and to the extent we aren't, we know
  that these are our respective areas of relative
  strength. Training/collaboration effort not just took time, it was
  also the kind of effort that involved meetings and documentation
  work where the process time / calendar time ratio was high (because
  it didn't involve thinking or processing new information, therefore
  could be done with focus over longer stretches). So, the reduced
  level of that effort means that I spend less work time overall, and
  also that my measured hours drop as a proportion of total hours.

* **Greater intensity and shorter duration of mini-tasks**: As
  individual tasks get streamlined, they become faster, but the
  cognitive effort on them doesn't necessarily go down; what goes down
  more is some of the overhead. In fact, the density of cognitive
  effort per unit time may go up.

## Hours targets over time

Company and time period | Hours target per week | Adherence? | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
LiftIgniter and then Maven, from early 2018 (measurement started March 2019) until June 2021 | 24 to 30 | I approximately adhered to this target on average. | Working at this level was fairly fatiguing and stressful, both in terms of the direct fatigue and the reduced time availability for other things.
Maven (that became Arena), starting July 2021 and prior to April 19, 2022| 21 (median of around 19-20, with surges to around 24-25) | I approximately adhered to this target on average. Working at this level was more relaxing, and gave me time to start pursuing personal projects when there weren't other crises to be addressed. However, I still didn't have a lot of space time-wise to pick up complex projects.
Half-time split across Arena and Equator (April 19, 2022 to September 30, 2022) | 6-8 for Arena, 15 for Equator | The split ended up being more like 12 hours and 13 hours; basically I ended up spending more time on Arena and less time on Equator than I'd have liked to. | This period was a bit more heavy work-wise than the period immediately preceding it. There was also a lot of one-off work related to my house move during the first few weeks of this period, though that work settled down. The extra work on Arena was concentrated in the last three months (July to September) and was due to the added complexity of offboarding -- during the maintenance mode I was in for May and June, I was able to adhere to my target range.
Full-time work on Equator (October 1, 2022 to March 3, 2023) | 25 | 21 (4 hours short) mainly due to challenges with the nature of the work | This was a difficult period for me. Although I wasn't working as hard (in terms of number of hours) as I had done at LiftIgniter and Maven prior to July 2021, the nature of the work made it more challenging to hit those hours goals. I also fell behind quite a bit on my work (compared to people's expectations) and it ultimately didn't pan out. In the months of October and November, there were also additional tasks related to the Arena wrap-up and some other things.
Half-time work at Arena (March 6, 2023 onward to May 31, 2023) while still spending some time on Equator wrap-up | 19 for Arena, 2 to 3 for Equator (just enough to wrap up very specific tasks) | Yes | Even though I was officially half-time on Arena, I decided to put in additional effort in the first few months to get back on top of things and build positive equity. So, I worked close to the original of around 21 hours per week that I had been doing in late 2021. I also spent time wrapping up predefined Equator tasks that I had not been able to finish prior to my official departure. Overall, the combination of these meant that I was only a little shy of working full-time.
Half-time work at Arena before formal setting of target hours (June 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023) | 12 to 14 | Yes | This was a period when I was handling some time-sensitive stuff on the devops side (GA4 migration) and also when I did my wisdom tooth removal and the bulk of work on 2022 taxes. Since these used up some of my work hours anyway, and also interrupted me from doing personal projects, I didn't aim for a lot on the work hours front, but also didn't try to start a lot more on the personal projects front.
Half-time work at Arena after formal setting of target hours (September 2023 onward) | evolved a lot, starting at 11 hours+, then changed to 9-13, then changed to 8-14 | Yes, with the exception of the period of travel to India where bureaucratic things ate up a lot of my time | As my biggest bureaucratic items were wrapping up at the end of August, I decided to revisit my target hours. I initially started with a minimum threshold of 11. However, I found that this, combined with some of the bureaucratic things I still needed to do, didn't give me enough time for personal projects. I eventually moved to a range of 9 to 13 hours, with moving averages across weeks being an option to allow for weeks where I was below 9 or above 13. Later, to give myself more flexibility, I changed the range to 8 to 14. I also set more relaxed minimums per week that didn't have a moving average clause. With the exception of the period of my travel to India, where my five-week moving average toward the end was about 7 hours, I've been able to stay within the range.

## Evolution of hours targets from September 2023 onward

## Thought process behind the evolution

Some of the criteria I've used for the hours targets are as follows:

* My goal with the hours targets is that neither the upper nor the
  lower end should be binding on me, forcing me locally to work or not
  work in ways that go against the natural flow of things. Rather, the
  hours targets should be wide enough to accommodate ups and downs of
  the job.

* I do use the hours targets to decide what sort of things I can or
  cannot pull into my plate. For instance, if I don't have enough
  projects to fill my hours targets over the coming weeks, I'll try to
  pull more in. If I have enough projects that I'm hitting the upper
  end of my hours targets, I'll try to pull less in.
